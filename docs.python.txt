# Getting Started with BrainyFlow

Welcome to BrainyFlow! This framework helps you build powerful, modular AI applications using a simple yet expressive abstraction based on nested directed graphs.

## 1. Installation

First, ensure you have BrainyFlow installed:

```bash
pip install brainyflow
```

For more installation options, see the [Installation Guide](./installation.md).

## 2. Core Concepts

BrainyFlow is built around a minimalist yet powerful abstraction that separates data flow from computation:

- **[Node](./core_abstraction/node.md)**: The fundamental building block that performs a single task with a clear lifecycle (`prep` → `exec` → `post`).
- **[Flow](./core_abstraction/flow.md)**: Orchestrates nodes in a directed graph, supporting branching, looping, and nesting.
- **[Memory](./core_abstraction/memory.md)**: Manages state, separating it into a shared `global` store and a forkable `local` store for isolated data flow between nodes.

## 3. Your First Flow

Let's build a simple Question-Answering flow to demonstrate BrainyFlow's core concepts:

### Step 1: Design Your Flow

Our flow will have two nodes:

1. `GetQuestionNode`: Captures the user's question
2. `AnswerNode`: Generates an answer using an LLM

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[GetQuestionNode] --> B[AnswerNode]
```

### Step 2: Implement the Nodes

```python
import asyncio
from brainyflow import Node, Flow, Memory
from utils import call_llm  # Your LLM implementation

class GetQuestionNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        """Get text input from user."""
        memory.question = input("Enter your question: ")

class AnswerNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        """Extract the question from memory."""
        return memory.question

    async def exec(self, question: str | None):
        """Call LLM to generate an answer."""

        prompt = f"Answer the following question: {question}"
        return await call_llm(prompt)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res: str | None, exec_res: str):
        """Store the answer in memory."""
        memory.answer = exec_res
        print(f"AnswerNode: Stored answer '{exec_res}'")
```

{% hint style="info" %}

**Review:** What was achieved here?

- `GetQuestionNode` gets the user's question and writes it to the `memory` object (global store), then explicitly `trigger`s the default next node.
- `AnswerNode` reads the question from the `memory` object, calls an LLM utility, writes the answer back to the `memory` object, and `trigger`s the next step (or ends the flow).

{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Connect the Nodes into a Flow

```python
from .nodes import GetQuestionNode, AnswerNode # defined in the previous step
from brainyflow import Flow

def create_qa_flow():
    get_question_node = GetQuestionNode()
    answer_node = AnswerNode()

    # Connect nodes get_question_node → answer_node using the default action
    get_question_node >> answer_node  # >> is Pythonic syntax sugar for .next(node)

    # Create the Flow, specifying the starting node
    return Flow(start=get_question_node)
```

{% hint style="info" %}

**Review:** What was achieved here?

- We instantiated the nodes and connected them using the default action (`>>` in Python, `.next()` in TypeScript).
- We created a `Flow` instance, telling it to start execution with `getQuestionNode`.

{% endhint %}

### Step 4: Run the Flow

```python
import asyncio
from .flow import create_qa_flow # defined in the previous step

async def main():
    memory = {} # Initialize empty memory (which acts as the global store)
    qa_flow = create_qa_flow()

    print("Running QA Flow...")
    # Run the flow, passing the initial global store.
    # The flow modifies the memory object in place.
    # The run method returns the final execution tree (we ignore it here).
    await qa_flow.run(memory)

    # Access the results stored in the global store
    print("\n--- Flow Complete ---")
    print(f"Question: {memory.question}")
    print(f"Answer: {memory.answer}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

{% hint style="info" %}

**Review:** What was achieved here?

- We initialized an empty `memory` object (Python dictionary or TS object) to serve as the global store.
- `qaFlow.run(memory)` executed the flow. The `Memory` instance managed the state internally, reading from and writing to the `memory` object we passed in.
- The final `question` and `answer` are directly accessible in the original `memory` object after the flow completes.

{% endhint %}

## 4. Key Design Principles

BrainyFlow follows these core design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Data storage (the `memory` object managing global/local stores) is separate from computation logic (`Node` classes).
2. **Explicit Data Flow**: Data dependencies between steps are clear and traceable through `memory` access in `prep`/`post` and the results passed between `prep` → `exec` → `post`.
3. **Composability**: Complex systems (`Flow`s) are built from simple, reusable components (`Node`s), and Flows themselves can be nested within other Flows.
4. **Minimalism**: The framework provides only essential abstractions (`Node`, `Flow`, `Memory`), avoiding vendor-specific implementations or excessive boilerplate.

# Framework Comparison: BrainyFlow vs Alternatives

BrainyFlow exists in an ecosystem of frameworks designed to build AI applications, particularly those centered around Large Language Models (LLMs). This chapter provides a comparative analysis of BrainyFlow against other popular frameworks in the AI orchestration space, highlighting the unique design principles and trade-offs that differentiate BrainyFlow from its alternatives.

## BrainyFlow's Philosophy Recap

Before diving into comparisons, let's reiterate BrainyFlow's core tenets:

- **Minimalist Core:** A tiny codebase (~200 lines in Python) providing essential abstractions (`Node`, `Flow`, `Memory`).
- **Graph-Based Abstraction:** Uses nested directed graphs to model application logic, separating data flow (`Memory`) from computation (`Node`).
- **Zero Dependencies:** The core framework has no external dependencies, offering maximum flexibility.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:** Encourages using external utilities directly, avoiding framework-specific wrappers for APIs or databases.
- **Agentic Coding Friendly:** Designed to be intuitive for both human developers and AI assistants collaborating on code.
- **Composability:** Flows can be nested within other flows, enabling modular design.

## Comparison Points

We'll compare BrainyFlow against competitors based on:

- **Core Abstraction:** The fundamental building blocks and mental model.
- **Dependencies & Size:** The footprint and external requirements.
- **Flexibility vs. Opinionation:** How much structure the framework imposes versus how much freedom the developer has.
- **Vendor Integrations:** Built-in support for specific LLMs, databases, etc.
- **Learning Curve:** Perceived difficulty in getting started and mastering the framework.

## BrainyFlow vs. PocketFlow (Origin)

BrainyFlow originated as a fork of PocketFlow, inheriting its core philosophy of minimalism and a graph-based abstraction. However, BrainyFlow has evolved with some key differences:

- **Core Abstraction:** PocketFlow is bloated with unnecessary specialized classes (e.g. `AsyncNode`, `BatchNode`, `AsyncBatchNode`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`, `AsyncFlow`, `BatchFlow`, `AsyncBatchFlow`, `AsyncParallelBatchFlow`). BrainyFlow simplifies this by removing all of them from the core. Instead, it relies only on standard `Node` lifecycle methods (which can be `async`) combined with `Flow` (or `ParallelFlow`) and the use of multiple `trigger` calls within a single node's `post` method to achieve batch-like fan-out operations.
- **State Management:** While both use a shared store, BrainyFlow places greater emphasis on the `Memory` object's `global` vs. `local` stores and using `forkingData` during `trigger` calls to manage branch-specific context, eliminating the need for PocketFlow's `Params` concept and all the complex `Batch` classes that come with it.
- **Focus:** BrainyFlow sharpens the focus on the fundamental `Node`, `Flow`, and `Memory` abstractions as the absolute core, reinforcing the idea that patterns like batching or parallelism are handled by how flows orchestrate standard nodes rather than requiring specialized node types.

Essentially, BrainyFlow refines PocketFlow's minimalist approach, aiming for an even leaner core by handling execution patterns like batching and parallelism primarily at the `Flow` orchestration level.

On top of that, BrainyFlow has been designed to be more agentic-friendly, with a focus on building flows that can be used by both humans and AI assistants. Its code is more readable and maintainable, prioritizing developer experience over an arbitrarily defined amount of lines of code.

## BrainyFlow vs. LangChain

- **Core Abstraction:** LangChain offers a vast array of components (Chains, LCEL, Agents, Tools, Retrievers, etc.). BrainyFlow focuses solely on the Node/Flow/Memory graph.
- **Dependencies & Size:** LangChain has numerous dependencies depending on the components used, leading to a larger footprint. BrainyFlow core is dependency-free.
- **Flexibility vs. Opinionation:** LangChain provides many pre-built components, which can be faster but potentially more opinionated. BrainyFlow offers higher flexibility, requiring developers to build or integrate utilities themselves.
- **Vendor Integrations:** LangChain has extensive built-in integrations. BrainyFlow intentionally avoids these in its core.
- **Learning Curve:** LangChain's breadth can be overwhelming. BrainyFlow's core is small, but mastering its flexible application requires understanding the graph pattern well.

## BrainyFlow vs. LangGraph

- **Core Abstraction:** LangGraph is built on LangChain and specifically focuses on cyclical graphs using a state-based approach. BrainyFlow uses action-based transitions between nodes within its graph structure.
- **Dependencies & Size:** LangGraph inherits LangChain's dependencies. BrainyFlow remains dependency-free.
- **Flexibility vs. Opinionation:** LangGraph is tied to the LangChain ecosystem and state management patterns. BrainyFlow offers more fundamental graph control.
- **Vendor Integrations:** Inherited from LangChain. BrainyFlow has none.
- **Learning Curve:** Requires understanding LangChain concepts plus LangGraph's state model. BrainyFlow focuses only on its core abstractions.

## BrainyFlow vs. CrewAI

- **Core Abstraction:** CrewAI provides higher-level abstractions like Agent, Task, and Crew, focusing on collaborative agent workflows. BrainyFlow provides the lower-level graph building blocks upon which such agent systems _can be built_.
- **Dependencies & Size:** CrewAI has dependencies related to its agent and tooling features. BrainyFlow is minimal.
- **Flexibility vs. Opinionation:** CrewAI is more opinionated towards specific multi-agent structures. BrainyFlow is more general-purpose.
- **Vendor Integrations:** CrewAI integrates with tools and LLMs, often via LangChain. BrainyFlow does not.
- **Learning Curve:** CrewAI's high-level concepts might be quicker for specific agent tasks. BrainyFlow requires building the agent logic from its core components.

## BrainyFlow vs. AutoGen

- **Core Abstraction:** AutoGen focuses on conversational agents (`ConversableAgent`) and multi-agent frameworks, often emphasizing automated chat orchestration. BrainyFlow focuses on the underlying execution graph.
- **Dependencies & Size:** AutoGen has a core set of dependencies, with optional ones for specific tools/models. BrainyFlow core has none.
- **Flexibility vs. Opinionation:** AutoGen is geared towards conversational agent patterns. BrainyFlow is a more general graph execution engine.
- **Vendor Integrations:** AutoGen offers integrations, particularly for LLMs. BrainyFlow avoids them.
- **Learning Curve:** AutoGen's conversational focus might be specific. BrainyFlow's graph is general but requires explicit construction.

| **Primary Focus**         | Graph Execution   | Component Library | State Machines       | Multi-Agent Collaboration | Conversational Agents | Graph Execution  |

## Conclusion: When to Choose BrainyFlow?

BrainyFlow excels when you prioritize:

- **Minimalism and Control:** You want a lightweight core without unnecessary bloat or dependencies.
- **Flexibility:** You prefer to integrate your own utilities and avoid framework-specific wrappers.
- **Understanding the Core:** You value a simple, fundamental abstraction (the graph) that you can build upon.
- **Avoiding Vendor Lock-in:** You want the freedom to choose and switch external services easily.
- **Agentic Coding:** You plan to collaborate with AI assistants, leveraging a framework they can easily understand and manipulate.

If you need extensive pre-built integrations, higher-level abstractions for specific patterns (like multi-agent collaboration out-of-the-box), or prefer a more opinionated framework, other options might be a better fit initially. However, BrainyFlow provides the fundamental building blocks to implement _any_ of these patterns with maximum transparency and control.

# Understanding BrainyFlow's Core Abstractions

BrainyFlow is built around a simple yet powerful abstraction: the **nested directed graph with shared store**. This mental model separates _data flow_ from _computation_, making complex LLM applications more maintainable and easier to reason about.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zvictor/brainyflow/main/.github/media/abstraction.jpg" width="1300"/>
</div>

## Core Philosophy

BrainyFlow follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Modularity & Composability**: Build complex systems from simple, reusable components that are easy to build, test, and maintain
2. **Explicitness**: Make data dependencies between steps clear and traceable
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Data storage (shared store) remains separate from computation logic (nodes)
4. **Minimalism**: The framework provides only essential abstractions, avoiding vendor-specific implementations while supporting various high-level AI design paradigms (agents, workflows, map-reduce, etc.)
5. **Resilience**: Handle failures gracefully with retries and fallbacks

## The Graph + Shared Store Pattern

The fundamental pattern in BrainyFlow combines two key elements:

- **Computation Graph**: A directed graph where nodes represent discrete units of work and edges represent the flow of control.
- **Shared Store**: A state management system that enables communication between nodes, separating global and local state.

This pattern offers several advantages:

- **Clear visualization** of application logic
- **Easy identification** of bottlenecks
- **Simple debugging** of individual components
- **Natural parallelization** opportunities

## Key Components

BrainyFlow's architecture is based on these fundamental building blocks:

| Component             | Description                                    | Key Features                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Node](./node.md)     | The basic unit of work                         | Clear lifecycle (`prep` → `exec` → `post`), fault tolerance (retries), graceful fallbacks                   |
| [Flow](./flow.md)     | Connects nodes together                        | Action-based transitions, branching, looping (with cycle detection), nesting, sequential/parallel execution |
| [Memory](./memory.md) | Manages state accessible during flow execution | Shared `global` store, forkable `local` store, cloning for isolation                                        |

## How They Work Together

1. **Nodes** perform individual tasks with a clear lifecycle:

   - `prep`: Read from shared store and prepare data
   - `exec`: Execute computation (often LLM calls)
   - `post`: Process results, write to shared store, and trigger next actions

2. **Flows** orchestrate nodes by:

   - Starting with a designated `start` node.
   - Following action-based transitions (`trigger` calls in `post`) between nodes.
   - Supporting branching, looping, and nested flows.
   - Executing triggered branches sequentially (`Flow`) or concurrently (`ParallelFlow`).
   - Supporting nested batch operations.

3. **Communication** happens through the `memory` instance provided to each node's lifecycle methods (in `prep` and `post` methods):

   - **Global Store**: A shared object accessible throughout the flow. Nodes typically write results here.
   - **Local Store**: An isolated object specific to a node and its downstream path.

## Getting Started

If you're new to BrainyFlow, we recommend exploring these core abstractions in the following order:

1. [Node](./node.md) - Understand the basic building block
2. [Flow](./flow.md) - Learn how to connect nodes together
3. [Memory](./memory.md) - See how nodes share data

Once you understand these core abstractions, you'll be ready to implement various [Design Patterns](../design_pattern/index.md) to solve real-world problems.




================================================
File: docs/core_abstraction/node.md
================================================
# Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks in BrainyFlow. Each node performs a specific task within your workflow, processing data and optionally triggering downstream nodes.

## Node Lifecycle

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/zvictor/brainyflow/raw/main/.github/media/node.jpg" width="400"/>
</div>

Every node follows a three-phase lifecycle:

1.  **`prep`**: Gather and prepare input data from the `memory` object.
2.  **`exec`**: Perform the main processing task (potentially retried). Receives data from `prep`. **Cannot** access the `memory` object directly.
3.  **`post`**: Process results, update the `memory` object (global or local store), and trigger downstream actions. Receives data from `prep` and `exec`, plus the `memory` instance.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why 3 steps?** This design enforces separation of concerns.

All steps are **optional**. For example, you can implement only `prep` and `post` if you just need to process data without external computation.
{% endhint %}

### 1. `async prep(memory)`

- Receives the current `memory` instance (a proxy managing global and local stores).
- Extracts necessary data by external sources or by accessing properties on the `memory` object (e.g., `memory.someData`). The proxy reads from the local store first, then the global store.
- Performs any required preprocessing or validation.
- Can optionally return a `PrepResult`, which is passed as input to `exec()` and `post()`.

### 2. `async exec(prepRes)`

- Receives the result from `prep()` (`prepRes`).
- Performs the main computation (e.g., LLM call, API request, calculation).
- ⚠️ **Cannot** access the `Memory` instance directly. This enforces separation and aids retry logic.
- ⚠️ Should ideally be idempotent (produce the same result given the same input) and have no side effects if retries (`maxRetries > 1`) are enabled, as it might be called multiple times.
- Returns an `ExecResult`, which is passed to `post()`.
- _Note:_ The actual execution logic, including retries, is handled by the internal `execRunner` method, which calls this `exec` method.

### 3. `async post(memory, prepRes, execRes)`

- Receives the `memory` instance, the result from `prep()` (`prepRes`), and the result from `exec()` (`execRes`).
- Processes results and writes data back to the `memory` object (usually the global store, e.g., `memory.result = execRes`).
- **This is the only place to call `this.trigger()`** to specify which downstream nodes should run next and optionally pass `forkingData` to their local memory.
  - If no `trigger` is called, the flow proceeds via the `DEFAULT_ACTION` ('default') with no specific `forkingData`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Memory (Proxy)
    participant N as Node

    N->>M: 1. prep(memory): Read from memory
    Note right of N: Return prep_res

    N->>N: 2. exec(prep_res): Compute result
    Note right of N: Return exec_res

    N->>M: 3. post(memory, prep_res, exec_res): Write to memory
    Note right of N: Trigger next actions
```

## Creating Custom Nodes

To create a custom node, extend the `Node` class and implement the lifecycle methods:

```python
from brainyflow import Node, Memory

class TextProcessorNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Read input data
        return memory.text

    async def exec(self, text: str):
        # Process the text
        return text.upper()

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, input_text: str, result: str):
        # Store the result in the global store
        memory.processed_text = result

        # Trigger the default next node (optional)
        self.trigger('default')
```

## Error Handling

Nodes include built-in retry capabilities for handling transient failures in `exec()` calls.

You can configure retries via the constructor:

- `maxRetries` (number): Maximum number of attempts for `exec()` (default: 1, meaning no retry).
- `wait` (number): Seconds to wait between retry attempts (default: 0).

The `wait` parameter is specially helpful when you encounter rate-limits or quota errors from your LLM provider and need to back off.
During retries, you can access the current retry count (0-based) via `self.cur_retry` (Python) or `this.curRetry` (TypeScript).

To handle failures gracefully after all retry attempts for `exec()` are exhausted, override the `execFallback` method.

By default, `execFallback` just re-raises the exception. You can override it to return a fallback result instead, which becomes the `exec_res` passed to `post()`, allowing the flow to potentially continue.

```python
from brainyflow import Node, Memory, NodeError

my_node = MyNode(max_retries=3, wait=10) # Assuming MyNode is defined elsewhere

class CustomErrorHandlingNode(Node):
    async def exec(self, prep_res):
        print(f"Exec attempt: {self.cur_retry + 1}")
        if self.cur_retry < 2:
             raise ValueError("Temporary failure!")
        return "Success on retry"

    async def exec_fallback(self, prep_res, error: NodeError) -> str:
        # This is called only if exec fails on the last attempt
        print(f"Exec failed after {error.retry_count + 1} attempts: {error}")
        # Return a fallback value instead of raising error
        return f"Fallback response due to repeated errors: {error}"

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res: str):
        # exec_res will be "Success on retry" or "Fallback response..."
        print(f"Post: Received result '{exec_res}'")
        memory.final_result = exec_res
        self.trigger('default')

```

## Triggering Successors (`trigger`)

Nodes signal which path(s) the flow should take next by calling `this.trigger()` within their `post` method.

```typescript
this.trigger(actionName: string | typeof DEFAULT_ACTION, forkingData?: SharedStore): void
```

- `actionName`: A string identifying the transition (e.g., 'success', 'failure', 'categoryA'). If omitted or if `trigger` is not called, `DEFAULT_ACTION` ('default') is assumed.
- `forkingData` (optional): An object containing data to be added _only_ to the `local` store of the `memory` instance passed to the triggered successor(s). This allows passing specific data down a particular branch without polluting the global store.

The running [Flow](./flow.md) uses the `actionName` to look up the successor nodes defined using `.on()` or `.next()`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`trigger()` can **only** be called inside the `post()` method. Calling it elsewhere will throw an error.
{% endhint %}

## Defining Connections (`on`, `next`)

While `trigger` determines _which_ path to take _during_ execution, you define the possible paths _before_ execution, by using either `.next()` or `.on()`, as shown below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python + sugar 🍭" %}

You can define transitions with syntax sugar:

1. **Basic default transition**: `node_a >> node_b`
   This means if `node_a` triggers the default action, go to `node_b`.

2. **Named action transition**: `node_a - "action_name" >> node_b`
   This means if `node_a` triggers `"action_name"`, go to `node_b`.

Note that `node_a >> node_b` is equivalent to `node_a - "default" >> node_b`

```python
# Basic default transition
node_a >> node_b  # If node_a triggers "default", go to node_b

# Named action transitions
node_a - "success" >> node_b  # If node_a triggers "success", go to node_b
node_a - "error" >> node_c    # If node_a triggers "error", go to node_c
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Python" %}

1. **Basic default transition**: `node_a.next(node_b)`
   This means if `node_a` triggers `"default"`, go to `node_b`.

2. **Named action transition**: `node_a.on('action_name', node_b)` or `node_a.next(node_b, 'action_name')`
   This means if `node_a` triggers `"action_name"`, go to `node_b`.

Note that `node_a.next(node_b)` is equivalent to both `node_a.next(node_b, 'default')` and `node_a.on('default', node_b)`

```python
# Basic default transition
node_a.next(node_b) # If node_a triggers "default", go to node_b

# Named action transition
node_a.on('success', node_b) # If node_a triggers "success", go to node_b
node_a.on('error', node_c) # If node_a triggers "error", go to node_c

# Alternative syntax
node_a.next(node_b, 'success') # Same as node_a.on('success', node_b)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To summarize it:

- `node.on(actionName, successorNode)`: Connects `successorNode` to be executed when `node` triggers `actionName`.
- `node.next(successorNode, actionName = DEFAULT_ACTION)`: A convenience method, equivalent to `node.on(actionName, successorNode)`.

These methods are typically called when constructing your `Flow`. See the [Flow documentation](./flow.md) for detailed examples of graph construction.

### Example: Conditional Branching

```python
from brainyflow import Node, Flow, Memory

# Assuming detect_language, EnglishProcessorNode, SpanishProcessorNode, UnknownProcessorNode are defined elsewhere

class RouterNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Read content from global memory
        return memory.content

    async def exec(self, content: str):
        return await detect_language(content)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, content: str, language: str):
        print(f"RouterPost: Detected language '{language}', storing and triggering.")
        memory.language = language
        # Trigger the specific action based on the detected language
        self.trigger(language) # e.g., trigger 'english' or 'spanish' or 'unknown'

# --- Flow Definition ---
router = RouterNode()
english_processor = EnglishProcessorNode()
spanish_processor = SpanishProcessorNode()
unknown_processor = UnknownProcessorNode() # Handle unknown case

# Define connections for specific actions using syntax sugar
router - "english" >> english_processor
router - "spanish" >> spanish_processor
router - "unknown" >> unknown_processor # Add path for unknown

flow = Flow(start=router)

# --- Execution Example ---
async def run_flow():
    memory_en = {"content": "Hello world"}
    await flow.run(memory_en)
    print("--- English Flow Done ---", memory_en)

    memory_es = {"content": "Hola mundo"}
    await flow.run(memory_es)
    print("--- Spanish Flow Done ---", memory_es)

    memory_unk = {"content": "Bonjour le monde"}
    await flow.run(memory_unk)
    print("--- Unknown Flow Done ---", memory_unk)

asyncio.run(run_flow())
```

### Example: Multiple Triggers (Fan-Out / Batch Processing)

A single node can call `this.trigger()` multiple times within its `post` method to initiate multiple downstream paths simultaneously. Each triggered path receives its own cloned `memory` instance, potentially populated with unique `local` data via the `forkingData` argument.

This "fan-out" capability is the core pattern used for **batch processing** (processing multiple items, often in parallel).

For a detailed explanation and examples of implementing batch processing using this fan-out pattern with `Flow` or `ParallelFlow`, please see the [Flow documentation](./flow.md#implementing-batch-processing-fan-out-pattern).

## Running Individual Nodes

Nodes have an extra method `run(memory)`, which calls `prep → exec → post`. Use it only for **testing or debugging individual nodes in isolation**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do NOT use `node.run()` to execute a workflow.**

`node.run()` executes only the single node it's called on. It **does not** look up or execute any successor nodes defined via `.on()` or `.next()`.

Always use `Flow.run()` or `ParallelFlow.run()` to execute a complete graph workflow. Using `node.run()` directly will lead to incomplete execution.
{% endhint %}

```typescript
// Run with propagate: false (default) - returns ExecResult
async node.run(memory: Memory | GlobalStore): Promise<ExecResult | void> // Accepts Memory object or initial global store

// Run with propagate: true - returns triggers for Flow execution
async node.run(memory: Memory | GlobalStore, propagate: true): Promise<[Action, Memory][]> // Accepts Memory object or initial global store
```

## Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Keep nodes focused on a single, well-defined task.
- **Read in `prep`**: Gather all necessary data from the `memory` object in the `prep` phase. Return only what `exec` needs.
- **Compute in `exec`**: Perform the core computation in `exec`. Keep it free of side effects and direct `memory` object access.
- **Write & Trigger in `post`**: Update the `memory` object (usually the global store) and call `trigger` in the `post` phase.
- **Use `forkingData`**: Pass branch-specific data via `trigger`'s `forkingData` argument to populate the `local` store for successors, keeping the global store clean.
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript generics (`Node<G, L, A, P, E>`) to define the expected structure of `memory` stores, actions, and results.
- **Error Handling**: Leverage the built-in retry logic (`maxRetries`, `wait`) and `execFallback` for resilience.

# Flow: Orchestrating Nodes in a Directed Graph

A **Flow** orchestrates a graph of Nodes, connecting them through action-based transitions. Flows enable you to create complex application logic including sequences, branches, loops, and nested workflows.

They manage the execution order, handle data flow between nodes, and provide error handling and cycle detection.

## Creating a Flow

A Flow begins with a **start node**, a memory state, and follows the [action-based transitions defined by the nodes](./nodes.md) until it reaches a node with no matching transition for its returned action.

```python
from brainyflow import Flow, Node

# Define nodes and transitions
# node_a = Node() ... etc.
node_a >> node_b
node_b - "success" >> node_c
node_b - "error" >> node_d

# Create a shared/global store (an empty dictionary)
memory = {}

# Create flow starting with node_a
flow = Flow(start=node_a)

# Run the flow, passing the memory object
await flow.run(memory)

# The memory object is modified in place
print("Flow finished. Final memory state:", memory)
```

## Flow Execution Process

When you call `flow.run(memory)`, the flow executes the following steps internally:

1.  It starts with the designated `start` node.
2.  For the current node, it executes its lifecycle (`prep` -> `execRunner` -> `post`), passing a `Memory` instance that wraps the global store and manages local state.
3.  It looks for triggered action (specified by `trigger()` calls), then it finds the corresponding successor node(s) defined by `.on()` or `.next()`.
4.  It recursively executes the successor node(s) with their respective cloned local memories.
5.  This process repeats until it reaches nodes that trigger actions with no defined successors, or the flow completes.
6.  The `run` method modifies the initial global store object in place and returns a nested structure representing the execution tree (often ignored if results are stored in memory).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Shared Store
    participant F as Flow
    participant N1 as Node A
    participant N2 as Node B

    F->>N1: Execute Node A
    N1->>S: Read from shared store
    N1->>N1: Perform computation
    N1->>S: Write to shared store
    N1-->>F: Return action "default"

    F->>F: Find next node for action "default"
    F->>N2: Execute Node B
    N2->>S: Read from shared store
    N2->>N1: Read from local store
    N2->>N2: Perform computation
    N2->>S: Write to shared store
    N2-->>F: Return action "success"

    F->>F: No transition defined for "success"
    F-->>F: Flow execution complete
```

## Controlling Flow Execution

### Branching and Looping

Flows support complex patterns like branching (conditionally following different paths) and looping (returning to previous nodes).

#### Example: Expense Approval Flow

Here's a simple expense approval flow that demonstrates branching and looping:

```python
from brainyflow import Flow, Node

# Define the nodes first
# review = ReviewExpenseNode()
# revise = ReviseReportNode()
# payment = ProcessPaymentNode()
# finish = FinishProcessNode()
# ...

# Define the flow connections
review - "approved" >> payment        # If approved, process payment
review - "needs_revision" >> revise   # If needs changes, go to revision
review - "rejected" >> finish         # If rejected, finish the process

revise >> review   # After revision, go back for another review
payment >> finish  # After payment, finish the process

# Create the flow
expense_flow = Flow(start=review)
```

This flow creates the following execution paths:

1. If `review` triggers `"approved"`, the expense moves to the `payment` node
2. If `review` triggers `"needs_revision"`, it goes to the `revise` node, which then loops back to `review`
3. If `review` triggers `"rejected"`, it moves to the `finish` node and stops

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    review[Review Expense] -->|approved| payment[Process Payment]
    review -->|needs_revision| revise[Revise Report]
    review -->|rejected| finish[Finish Process]

    revise --> review
    payment --> finish
```

### Flow as a Node

Every `Flow` is in fact a specialized type of `Node`. This means a `Flow` itself can be used as a node within another, larger `Flow`, enabling powerful composition and nesting patterns.

{% hint style="info" %}
The difference from Node is that `Flow` has a specialized `execRunner()` method - _the internal caller of `exec()`_ - that orchestrates its internal nodes and which cannot be overridden.
As such:

- A `Flow`'s primary role is orchestration, not direct computation like a standard `Node`.
- You cannot override `exec` or `execRunner` in a `Flow`.
- It still has the `prep` and `post` lifecycle methods, which you _can_ override if you need to perform setup before the sub-flow runs or cleanup/processing after it completes.
- When a `Flow` used as a node finishes its internal execution, it triggers its _own_ successors in the parent flow based on its `post` method's `trigger` calls (or the default action).

{% endhint %}

This allows you to:

1. Break down complex applications into manageable sub-flows
2. Reuse flows across different applications
3. Create hierarchical workflows with clear separation of concerns

#### Example: Order Processing Pipeline

Here's a practical example that breaks down order processing into nested flows:

```python
from brainyflow import Flow, Node

# Payment processing sub-flow
validate_payment >> process_payment >> payment_confirmation
payment_flow = Flow(start=validate_payment)

# Inventory sub-flow
check_stock >> reserve_items >> update_inventory
inventory_flow = Flow(start=check_stock)

# Shipping sub-flow
create_label >> assign_carrier >> schedule_pickup
shipping_flow = Flow(start=create_label)

# Connect the flows into a main order pipeline
payment_flow >> inventory_flow >> shipping_flow

# Create the master flow
order_pipeline = Flow(start=payment_flow)

# Run the entire pipeline
memory = { orderId: 'XYZ789', customerId: 'CUST123' }
await order_pipeline.run(memory)
```

This creates a clean separation of concerns while maintaining a clear execution path:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph order_pipeline[Order Pipeline]
        subgraph paymentFlow["Payment Flow"]
            A[Validate Payment] --> B[Process Payment] --> C[Payment Confirmation]
        end

        subgraph inventoryFlow["Inventory Flow"]
            D[Check Stock] --> E[Reserve Items] --> F[Update Inventory]
        end

        subgraph shippingFlow["Shipping Flow"]
            G[Create Label] --> H[Assign Carrier] --> I[Schedule Pickup]
        end

        paymentFlow --> inventoryFlow
        inventoryFlow --> shippingFlow
    end
```

### Cycle Detection

Loops are created by connecting a node back to a previously executed node. To prevent infinite loops, `Flow` includes cycle detection controlled by the `maxVisits` option in its constructor (default is 5). If a node is visited more times than `maxVisits` during a single run, an error is thrown.

{% hint style="success" %}
This ensures that the flow does not get stuck in an infinite loop.
{% endhint %}

```typescript
// Limit the number of times a node can be visited within this flow
const flow = new Flow(startNode, { maxVisits: 10 })
```

- The default value for `maxVisits` is `5`.
- Set `maxVisits` to `Infinity` or a very large number for effectively no limit (use with caution!).

## Flow Parallelism

BrainyFlow offers two built-in types - _and the possibility to create custom ones_ - of flows that provide different levels of parallelism when nodes trigger multiple successors:

### 1. `Flow` (Sequential Execution)

The default `Flow` class executes the tasks generated by multiple triggers **sequentially**. It waits for the entire branch initiated by the first trigger to complete before starting the branch for the second trigger, and so on.

```typescript
const sequentialFlow = new Flow(startNode)
```

### 2. `ParallelFlow` (Concurrent Execution)

The `ParallelFlow` class executes the tasks generated by multiple triggers **concurrently** using `Promise.all()` (TypeScript) or `asyncio.gather()` (Python). This is useful for performance when branches are independent (e.g., batch processing items).

```typescript
// Executes triggered branches in parallel
const parallelFlow = new ParallelFlow(startNode)
```

Use `ParallelFlow` when:

1.  A node needs to "fan-out" work into multiple independent branches (e.g., processing items in a batch).
2.  These branches do not have dependencies on each other's immediate results (though they might all write back to the shared global memory).
3.  You want to potentially speed up execution by running these independent branches concurrently.

{% hint style="danger" %}

When using `ParallelFlow`, be mindful of potential race conditions if multiple parallel branches try to modify the same property in the global `Memory` simultaneously without proper synchronization. Often, it's safer for parallel branches to accumulate results locally or use unique keys in the global store, followed by a final sequential aggregation step.

{% endhint %}

### Custom Execution Logic (Overriding `runTasks`)

For more advanced control over how triggered branches are executed, you can extend `Flow` (or `ParallelFlow`) and override the `runTasks` method. This method receives an array of functions, where each function represents the execution of one triggered branch.

```typescript
import { Flow, Memory } from 'brainyflow'

declare function sleep(ms: number): Promise<void> // Assuming sleep is available

class CustomExecutionFlow extends Flow {
  async runTasks<T>(tasks: (() => Promise<T>)[]): Promise<Awaited<T>[]> {
    // Example: Run tasks sequentially with a delay between each
    const results: Awaited<T>[] = []
    for (const task of tasks) {
      results.push(await task())
      console.log('Custom runTasks: Task finished, waiting 1s...')
      await sleep(1000) // Wait 1 second between tasks
    }
    return results
  }
}
```

## Batch Processing (Fan-Out Pattern)

The standard way to process multiple items (sequentially or in parallel) is using the "fan-out" pattern with multiple triggers. All you need for that is a trigger node and a processor node:

1.  **Trigger Node**:
    - A standard `Node` whose `post` method iterates through your items (e.g., from `prepRes.items`).
    - For each item, it calls `this.trigger` with forking data. E.g., `this.trigger("process_item", { item: current_item, index: i })`.
    - The forked data is crucial for passing item-specific data to the local memory of the next node.
2.  **Processor Node**:
    - Another standard `Node` connected via the action triggered by the `TriggerNode`. E.g. `triggerNode.on("process_item", processorNode)`.
    - Its `prep` reads the forked data from its local memory.
    - Its `exec` performs the actual processing for that single item.
    - Its `post` typically stores the result back into global memory (e.g., `memory.results[prepRes.index] = execRes.result`).
3.  **Flow Choice**:
    - Use `Flow(triggerNode)` for **sequential** batch processing (one item completes before the next starts).
    - Use `ParallelFlow(triggerNode)` for **concurrent** batch processing (all items are processed in parallel).

This pattern leverages the core `Flow` and `Node` abstractions to handle batching effectively.

#### Example: Simple Batch Processing

```python
class TriggerBatchNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        return memory.items_to_process or []

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res: list, exec_res):
        items = prep_res
        memory.results = [None] * len(items) # Pre-allocate for parallel
        for index, item in enumerate(items):
            self.trigger("process_one", {"item_data": item, "result_index": index})
        # Optional: self.trigger("aggregate") if needed

class ProcessOneItemNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        return {"item": memory.item_data, "index": memory.result_index}

    async def exec(self, prep_res):
        result = f"Processed {prep_res['item']}" # Placeholder
        return {"result": result, "index": prep_res["index"]}

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        memory.results[exec_res["index"]] = exec_res["result"]

# Setup
trigger = TriggerBatchNode()
processor = ProcessOneItemNode()
trigger - "process_one" >> processor

# Choose Flow type
# sequential_batch_flow = Flow(trigger)
parallel_batch_flow = ParallelFlow(trigger)

# Run
# memory = {"items_to_process": ["A", "B", "C"]}
# await parallel_batch_flow.run(memory)
# print(memory["results"]) # Output: ['Processed A', 'Processed B', 'Processed C']
```

In this example, `TriggerBatchNode` fans out the work. If run with `ParallelFlow`, each `ItemProcessorNode` instance would execute concurrently. If run with a standard `Flow`, they would execute sequentially.

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with a linear flow and add branching/looping complexity gradually.
- **Visualize First**: Sketch your flow diagram (using Mermaid or similar tools) before coding to clarify logic.
- **Flow Modularity**: Design flows as reusable components. Break down complex processes into smaller, nested sub-flows.
- **Memory Planning**: Define clear interfaces for your `GlobalStore` and `LocalStore` upfront. Decide what state needs to be global versus what can be passed locally via `forkingData`.
- **Action Naming**: Use descriptive, meaningful action names (e.g., 'user_clarification_needed', 'data_validated') instead of generic names like 'next' or 'step2'.
- **Explicit Transitions**: Clearly define transitions for all expected actions a node might trigger. Consider adding default `.next()` transitions for unexpected or completion actions.
- **Cycle Management**: Be mindful of loops. Use the `maxVisits` option in the `Flow` constructor to prevent accidental infinite loops.
- **Error Strategy**: Decide how errors should propagate. Should a node's `execFallback` handle errors and allow the flow to continue, or should errors terminate the flow? Define specific error actions (`node.on('error', errorHandlerNode)`) if needed.
- **Parallelism Choice**: Use `ParallelFlow` when branches are independent and can benefit from concurrent execution. Stick with `Flow` (sequential) if branches have dependencies or shared resource contention.
- **Memory Isolation**: Leverage `forkingData` in `trigger` calls to pass data down specific branches via the `local` store, keeping the `global` store cleaner. This is crucial for parallel execution.
- **Test Incrementally**: Test individual nodes using `node.run()` and test sub-flows before integrating them into larger pipelines.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: While nesting flows is powerful, keep the hierarchy reasonably flat (e.g., 2-3 levels deep) for maintainability.

Flows provide the orchestration layer that determines how your nodes interact, ensuring that data moves predictably through your application and that execution follows your intended paths.

By following these principles, you can create complex, maintainable AI applications that are easy to reason about and extend.

# Memory: Managing State Between Nodes

BrainyFlow provides a streamlined approach for components to communicate with each other. This chapter explains how data is stored, accessed, and isolated.

## Memory Scopes: Global vs. Local

Each `Memory` instance encapsulates two distinct scopes:

1.  **Global Store (`memory`)**: A single object shared across _all_ nodes within a single `flow.run()` execution. Changes made here persist throughout the flow. Think of it as the main shared state.
2.  **Local Store (`memory.local`)**: An object specific to a particular execution path within the flow. It's created when a node `trigger`s a successor. Changes here are isolated to that specific branch and its descendants.

This dual-scope system allows for both shared application state (global) and controlled, path-specific data propagation (local).

{% hint style="success" %}
**Real-World Analogies**:

Think of the memory system like **a river delta**:

- **Global Store**: The main river water that flows everywhere
- **Local Store**: Specific channels that might carry unique properties that only affect downstream areas fed by that channel

Alternatively, think of it like **nested scopes in programming**:

- **Global Store**: Like variables declared in the outermost scope of a program, accessible everywhere.
- **Local Store**: Like variables declared inside a function or block. They are only accessible within that block and any nested blocks (downstream nodes in the flow). If a local variable has the same name as a global one, the local variable "shadows" the global one within its scope.

This model gives you the flexibility to share data across your entire flow (global) or isolate context to specific execution paths (local).
{% endhint %}

## Accessing Memory (Reading)

Nodes access data stored in either scope through the `memory` proxy instance passed to their `prep` and `post` methods. When you read a property (e.g., `memory.someValue`), the proxy automatically performs a lookup:

1.  It checks the **local store (`memory.local`)** first.
2.  If the property is not found locally, it checks the **global store (`memory`)**.

```typescript
import { Memory, Node } from 'brainyflow'

interface MyGlobal {
  config?: object
  commonData?: string
  pathSpecificData?: string
}
interface MyLocal {
  pathSpecificData?: string
} // Can shadow global

class MyNode extends Node<MyGlobal, MyLocal> {
  async prep(memory: Memory<MyGlobal, MyLocal>): Promise<void> {
    // Reads from global store (assuming not set locally)
    const config = memory.config
    const common = memory.commonData

    // Reads from local store if set via forkingData, otherwise reads from global
    const specific = memory.pathSpecificData
  }
  // ... exec, post ...
}
```

When accessing memory, you should always use `memory.someValue` and let the `Memory` manager figure out where to fetch the value for you.
You could also directly access the entire local store object using `memory.local` - or a value at `memory.local.someValue` - but that's an anti-pattern that should be avoided.

```typescript
async post(memory: Memory<MyGlobal, MyLocal>, /*...*/) {
    const allLocalData = memory.local; // Access the internal __local object directly
    console.log('Current local store:', allLocalData);
}
```

## Writing to Memory

- **Writing to Global Store**: Assigning a value directly to a property on the `memory` object (e.g., `memory.someValue = 'new data'`) writes to the **global store**. The proxy automatically removes the property from the local store first if it exists there.
- **Writing to Local Store**: While possible via `memory.local.someValue = 'new data'`, the primary and recommended way to populate the local store for downstream nodes is using the `forkingData` argument in `this.trigger()`.

```python
from brainyflow import Node, Memory

# Assume exec returns a dict like {"files": [...], "count": ...}
class DataWriterNode(Node):
    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res: dict):
        # --- Writing to Global Store ---
        # Accessible to all nodes in the flow and outside
        memory.fileList = exec_res["files"]
        print(f"Memory updated globally: fileList={memory.fileList}")

        # --- Writing to Local Store ---
        # Accessible to this node and all descendants
        memory.local.processedCount = exec_res["count"]
        print(f"Memory updated locally: processedCount={memory.processedCount}")

        # --- Triggering with Local Data (Forking Data) ---
        # 'file' will be added to the local store of the memory clone
        # passed to the node(s) triggered by the 'process_file' action.
        for file_item in exec_res["files"]:
            self.trigger('process_file', { "file": file_item })

# Example Processor Node (triggered by 'process_file')
class FileProcessorNode(Node):
     async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
         # Reads 'file' from the local store first, then global
         file_to_process = memory.file
         print(f"Processing file (fetched from local memory): {file_to_process}")
         return file_to_process
     # ... exec, post ...
```

## Best Practices

- **Read in `prep()`**: Gather necessary input data from `memory` at the beginning of a node's execution.
- **Write Global State in `post()`**: Update the shared global store by assigning to `memory` properties (e.g., `memory.results = ...`) in the `post()` phase after processing is complete.
- **Set Local State via `forkingData`**: Pass branch-specific context to successors by providing the `forkingData` argument in `this.trigger()` within the parent's `post()` method. This populates the `local` store for the next node(s).
- **Read Transparently**: Always read data via the `memory` proxy (e.g., `memory.someValue`). It handles the local-then-global lookup automatically. Avoid reading directly from `memory.local` or other internal properties unless strictly needed.

## When to Use The Memory

- **Ideal for**: Sharing data results, large content, or information needed by multiple components
- **Benefits**: Separates data from computation logic (separation of concerns)
- **Global Memory**: Use for application-wide state, configuration, and final results
- **Local Memory**: Use for passing contextual data down a specific execution path

## Technical Concepts

The memory system in BrainyFlow implements several established computer science patterns:

- **Lexical Scoping**: Local memory "shadows" global memory, similar to how local variables in functions can shadow global variables
- **Context Propagation**: Local memory propagates down the execution tree, similar to how context flows in React or middleware systems
- **Transparent Resolution**: The system automatically resolves properties from the appropriate memory scope

## Remember

1.  **Reading**: Always read via the `memory` proxy (e.g., `memory.value`). It checks local then global.
2.  **Writing**: Direct assignment `memory.property = value` writes to the **global** store.
3.  **Local State Creation**: Use `trigger(action, forkingData)` in `post()` to populate the `local` store for the _next_ node(s) in a specific branch.
4.  **Lifecycle**: Read from `memory` in `prep`, compute in `exec` (no memory access), write global state to `memory` and trigger successors (potentially with `forkingData` for local state) in `post`.

## Choosing the Right Pattern

When designing your application, consider these factors when selecting a pattern:

| Pattern           | Best For                  | When To Use                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| RAG               | Knowledge-intensive tasks | When external information is needed for responses       |
| Agent             | Dynamic problem-solving   | When tasks require reasoning and decision-making        |
| Workflow          | Sequential processing     | When steps are well-defined and follow a clear order    |
| Map Reduce        | Large data processing     | When handling datasets too large for a single operation |
| Structured Output | Consistent formatting     | When outputs need to follow specific schemas            |
| Multi-Agents      | Complex collaboration     | When tasks benefit from specialized agent roles         |

### Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to help determine which pattern best fits your use case:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Need to process large data?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Data can be processed independently?}
    B -->|No| D{Need to make decisions?}

    C -->|Yes| E[Map Reduce]
    C -->|No| F[Workflow]

    D -->|Yes| G{Complex, multi-step reasoning?}
    D -->|No| H[Simple Workflow]

    G -->|Yes| I{Need multiple specialized roles?}
    G -->|No| J{Need external knowledge?}

    I -->|Yes| K[Multi-Agents]
    I -->|No| L[Agent]

    J -->|Yes| M[RAG]
    J -->|No| N[Structured Output]
```

## Pattern Composition

BrainyFlow's nested flow capability allows you to compose multiple patterns. For instance:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Agent Pattern"
        A[Perceive] --> B[Think]
        B --> C[Act]
        C --> A
    end

    subgraph "RAG Pattern"
        D[Query] --> E[Retrieve]
        E --> F[Generate]
    end

    A --> D
    F --> B
```

This composition enables powerful applications that combine the strengths of different patterns.
For example, an agent might use RAG to access knowledge, then apply chain-of-thought reasoning to solve a problem.
Other examples include:

- An **Agent** that uses **RAG** to retrieve information before making decisions
- A **Workflow** that includes **Map Reduce** steps for processing large datasets
- **Multi-Agents** that each use **Structured Output** for consistent communication

## Implementation Examples

Each pattern can be implemented using BrainyFlow's core abstractions. Here's a simple example of the agent pattern:

```python
from brainyflow import Flow, Node

# Define the agent's components (assuming these classes exist)
perceive = PerceiveNode()
think = ThinkNode()
act = ActNode()

# Connect them in a cycle
perceive >> think >> act >> perceive

# Create the agent flow
agent_flow = Flow(start=perceive)
```

For more detailed implementations of each pattern, see the individual pattern documentation pages.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest pattern that meets your needs
2. **Modular Design**: Design patterns to be composable and reusable
3. **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces between pattern components
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each pattern component before integration
5. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for bottlenecks in your pattern implementation

By understanding and applying these design patterns, you can build sophisticated AI applications that are both powerful and maintainable.

# Agent

Agent is a powerful design pattern in which nodes can take dynamic actions based on the context.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/zvictor/brainyflow/raw/main/.github/media/agent.png?raw=true" width="350"/>
</div>

## Implement Agent with Graph

1. **Context and Action:** Implement nodes that supply context and perform actions.
2. **Branching:** Use branching to connect each action node to an agent node. Use action to allow the agent to direct the [flow](../core_abstraction/flow.md) between nodes—and potentially loop back for multi-step.
3. **Agent Node:** Provide a prompt to decide action—for example:

````python
f"""
### CONTEXT
Task: {task_description}
Previous Actions: {previous_actions}
Current State: {current_state}

### ACTION SPACE
[1] search
  Description: Use web search to get results
  Parameters:
    - query (str): What to search for

[2] answer
  Description: Conclude based on the results
  Parameters:
    - result (str): Final answer to provide

### NEXT ACTION
Decide the next action based on the current context and available action space.
Return your response in the following format:

```yaml
thinking: |
    <your step-by-step reasoning process>
action: <action_name>
parameters:
    <parameter_name>: <parameter_value>
```"""
````

The core of building **high-performance** and **reliable** agents boils down to:

1. **Context Management:** Provide _relevant, minimal context._ For example, rather than including an entire chat history, retrieve the most relevant via [RAG](./rag.md). Even with larger context windows, LLMs still fall victim to ["lost in the middle"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), overlooking mid-prompt content.

2. **Action Space:** Provide _a well-structured and unambiguous_ set of actions—avoiding overlap like separate `read_databases` or `read_csvs`. Instead, import CSVs into the database.

## Example Good Action Design

- **Incremental:** Feed content in manageable chunks (500 lines or 1 page) instead of all at once.

- **Overview-zoom-in:** First provide high-level structure (table of contents, summary), then allow drilling into details (raw texts).

- **Parameterized/Programmable:** Instead of fixed actions, enable parameterized (columns to select) or programmable (SQL queries) actions, for example, to read CSV files.

- **Backtracking:** Let the agent undo the last step instead of restarting entirely, preserving progress when encountering errors or dead ends.

## Example: Search Agent

This agent:

1. Decides whether to search or answer
2. If searches, loops back to decide if more search needed
3. Answers when enough context gathered

````python

        ]
        self.trigger('decide')

       print(f"Answer: {exec_res}")
       memory.answer = exec_res
       # No trigger needed if this is the end of the path
```

```python

decide = DecideAction()

decide - "search" >> search

    result = await flow.run(memory_data) # Pass memory object

# Workflow

Many real-world tasks are too complex for one LLM call. The solution is **Task Decomposition**: decompose them into a [chain](../core_abstraction/flow.md) of multiple Nodes.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/zvictor/brainyflow/raw/main/.github/media/workflow.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
</div>

{% hint style="success" %}
You don't want to make each task **too coarse**, because it may be _too complex for one LLM call_.
You don't want to make each task **too granular**, because then _the LLM call doesn't have enough context_ and results are _not consistent across nodes_.

You usually need multiple _iterations_ to find the _sweet spot_. If the task has too many _edge cases_, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).
{% endhint %}

### Example: Article Writing

```python
import asyncio
from brainyflow import Node, Flow, Memory

# Assume call_llm is defined elsewhere
# async def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str: ...

class GenerateOutline(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory): return memory.topic
    async def exec(self, topic): return await call_llm(f"Create a detailed outline for an article about {topic}")
    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        memory.outline = exec_res
        self.trigger('default')

class WriteSection(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory): return memory.outline
    async def exec(self, outline): return await call_llm(f"Write content based on this outline: {outline}")
    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        memory.draft = exec_res
        self.trigger('default')

class ReviewAndRefine(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory): return memory.draft
    async def exec(self, draft): return await call_llm(f"Review and improve this draft: {draft}")
    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        memory.final_article = exec_res
        # No trigger needed if this is the end of the flow

# Connect nodes
outline = GenerateOutline()
write = WriteSection()
review = ReviewAndRefine()

outline >> write >> review

# Create and run flow
writing_flow = Flow(start=outline)

async def main():
    memory = {"topic": "AI Safety"}
    await writing_flow.run(memory) # Pass memory object
    print("Final Article:", memory.get("final_article", "Not generated")) # Access memory object

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For _dynamic cases_, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

For certain LLM tasks like answering questions, providing relevant context is essential. One common architecture is a **two-stage** RAG pipeline:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/zvictor/brainyflow/raw/main/.github/media/rag.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
</div>

1. **Offline stage**: Preprocess and index documents ("building the index").
2. **Online stage**: Given a question, generate answers by retrieving the most relevant context.

---

## Stage 1: Offline Indexing

We create three Nodes:

1. `ChunkDocs` – [chunks](../utility_function/chunking.md) raw text.
2. `EmbedDocs` – [embeds](../utility_function/embedding.md) each chunk.
3. `StoreIndex` – stores embeddings into a [vector database](../utility_function/vector.md).

```python
import asyncio
import os # Assuming file operations
from brainyflow import Node, Flow, Memory, ParallelFlow

# Assume get_embedding, create_index, search_index are defined elsewhere
# async def get_embedding(text: str) -> list[float]: ...
# def create_index(embeddings: list[list[float]]) -> Any: ... # Returns index object
# def search_index(index: Any, query_embedding: list[float], top_k: int) -> tuple[list[list[int]], list[list[float]]]: ...

# --- Stage 1: Offline Indexing Nodes ---

# 1a. Node to trigger chunking for each file
class TriggerChunkingNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        return memory.files or []

    async def exec(self, files: list):
         # Optional: could return file count or validate paths
         return len(files)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, files: list, file_count: int):
        print(f"Triggering chunking for {file_count} files.")
        memory.all_chunks = [] # Initialize chunk store
        memory.chunk_metadata = [] # Store metadata like source file
        for index, filepath in enumerate(files):
            if os.path.exists(filepath): # Basic check
                 self.trigger('chunk_file', { "filepath": filepath, "file_index": index })
            else:
                 print(f"Warning: File not found {filepath}")
        # Trigger next major step after attempting all files
        self.trigger('embed_chunks')

# 1b. Node to chunk a single file
class ChunkFileNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Read filepath from local memory
        return memory.filepath, memory.file_index

    async def exec(self, prep_res):
        filepath, file_index = prep_res
        print(f"Chunking {filepath}")
        try:
            with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                text = f.read()
            # Simple fixed-size chunking
            chunks = []
            size = 100
            for i in range(0, len(text), size):
                chunks.append(text[i : i + size])
            return chunks, filepath # Pass filepath for metadata
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error chunking {filepath}: {e}")
            return [], filepath # Return empty list on error

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        chunks, filepath = exec_res
        file_index = prep_res[1]
        # Append chunks and their source metadata to global lists
        # Note: If using ParallelFlow, direct append might lead to race conditions.
        # Consider storing per-file results then combining in the next step.
        start_index = len(memory.all_chunks)
        memory.all_chunks.extend(chunks)
        for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
             memory.chunk_metadata.append({"source": filepath, "chunk_index_in_file": i, "global_chunk_index": start_index + i})
        # This node doesn't trigger further processing for this specific file branch

# 1c. Node to trigger embedding for each chunk
class TriggerEmbeddingNode(Node):
     async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
         # This node runs after all 'chunk_file' triggers are processed by the Flow
         return memory.all_chunks or []

     async def exec(self, chunks: list):
         return len(chunks)

     async def post(self, memory: Memory, chunks: list, chunk_count: int):
         print(f"Triggering embedding for {chunk_count} chunks.")
         memory.all_embeds = [None] * chunk_count # Pre-allocate list for parallel writes
         for index, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
             # Pass chunk and its global index via forkingData
             self.trigger('embed_chunk', { "chunk": chunk, "global_index": index })
         # Trigger storing index after all embedding triggers are fired
         self.trigger('store_index')

# 1d. Node to embed a single chunk
class EmbedChunkNode(Node):
     async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
         # Read chunk and global index from local memory
         return memory.chunk, memory.global_index

     async def exec(self, prep_res):
         chunk, index = prep_res
         # print(f"Embedding chunk {index}") # Can be noisy
         return await get_embedding(chunk), index # Pass index through

     async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
         embedding, index = exec_res
         # Store embedding at the correct index in the pre-allocated list
         memory.all_embeds[index] = embedding
         # This node doesn't trigger further processing for this chunk branch
```

```python
# 1e. Node to store the final index
class StoreIndexNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Read all embeddings from global memory
        # Filter out potential None values if embedding failed for some chunks
        embeddings = [emb for emb in (memory.all_embeds or []) if emb is not None]
        if len(embeddings) != len(memory.all_embeds or []):
             print(f"Warning: Some chunks failed to embed. Indexing {len(embeddings)} embeddings.")
        return embeddings

    async def exec(self, all_embeds: list):
        if not all_embeds:
             print("No embeddings to store.")
             return None
        print(f"Storing index for {len(all_embeds)} embeddings.")
        # Create a vector index (implementation depends on library)
        index = create_index(all_embeds)
        return index

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, index):
        # Store the created index in global memory
        memory.index = index
        if index:
             print('Index created and stored.')
        else:
             print('Index creation skipped.')
        # End of offline flow
```

```python
# --- Offline Flow Definition ---
trigger_chunking = TriggerChunkingNode()
chunk_file = ChunkFileNode()
trigger_embedding = TriggerEmbeddingNode()
embed_chunk = EmbedChunkNode()
store_index = StoreIndexNode()

# Define transitions using syntax sugar
trigger_chunking - 'chunk_file' >> chunk_file
trigger_chunking - 'embed_chunks' >> trigger_embedding
trigger_embedding - 'embed_chunk' >> embed_chunk
trigger_embedding - 'store_index' >> store_index

# Use ParallelFlow for potentially faster chunking and embedding
OfflineFlow = ParallelFlow(start=trigger_chunking)
# Or sequential: OfflineFlow = Flow(start=trigger_chunking)
```

Usage example:

```python
# --- Offline Flow Execution ---
async def run_offline():
    # Create dummy files for example
    if not os.path.exists('doc1.txt'): fs.writeFileSync('doc1.txt', 'Alice was beginning to get very tired.')
    if not os.path.exists('doc2.txt'): fs.writeFileSync('doc2.txt', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')

    initial_memory = {
        "files": ["doc1.txt", "doc2.txt"], # Example file paths
    }
    print('Starting offline indexing flow...')

    await OfflineFlow.run(initial_memory)

    print('Offline indexing complete.')
    # Clean up dummy files
    # os.remove('doc1.txt')
    # os.remove('doc2.txt')
    return initial_memory # Return memory containing index, chunks, embeds

# asyncio.run(run_offline()) # Example call
```

## Stage 2: Online Query & Answer

We have 3 nodes:

1. `EmbedQuery` – embeds the user’s question.
2. `RetrieveDocs` – retrieves top chunk from the index.
3. `GenerateAnswer` – calls the LLM with the question + chunk to produce the final answer.

```python
# --- Stage 2: Online Query Nodes ---

# 2a. Embed Query Node
class EmbedQueryNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        return memory.question # Read from memory

    async def exec(self, question):
        print(f"Embedding query: \"{question}\"")
        return await get_embedding(question)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, q_emb):
        memory.q_emb = q_emb # Write to memory
        self.trigger('retrieve_docs')
```

```python
# 2b. Retrieve Docs Node
class RetrieveDocsNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Need query embedding, index, and original chunks
        # Also retrieve metadata to know the source
        return memory.q_emb, memory.index, memory.all_chunks, memory.chunk_metadata

    async def exec(self, inputs):
        q_emb, index, chunks, metadata = inputs
        if not q_emb or not index or not chunks:
            raise ValueError("Missing data for retrieval in memory")
        print("Retrieving relevant chunk...")
        # Assuming search_index returns [[ids]], [[distances]]
        I, D = search_index(index, q_emb, top_k=1)
        if not I or not I[0]:
             return "Could not find relevant chunk.", None
        best_global_id = I[0][0]
        if best_global_id >= len(chunks):
             return "Index out of bounds.", None

        relevant_chunk = chunks[best_global_id]
        relevant_metadata = metadata[best_global_id] if metadata and best_global_id < len(metadata) else {}
        return relevant_chunk, relevant_metadata

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        relevant_chunk, relevant_metadata = exec_res
        memory.retrieved_chunk = relevant_chunk # Write to memory
        memory.retrieved_metadata = relevant_metadata # Write metadata too
        print(f"Retrieved chunk: {relevant_chunk[:60]}... (Source: {relevant_metadata.get('source', 'N/A')})")
        self.trigger('generate_answer')
```

```python
# 2c. Generate Answer Node
class GenerateAnswerNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        return memory.question, memory.retrieved_chunk # Read from memory

    async def exec(self, inputs):
        question, chunk = inputs
        if not chunk or chunk == "Could not find relevant chunk.":
             return "Sorry, I couldn't find relevant information to answer the question."
        prompt = f"Using the following context, answer the question.\nContext: {chunk}\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
        print("Generating final answer...")
        return await call_llm(prompt)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, answer):
        memory.answer = answer # Write to memory
        print("Answer:", answer)
        # End of online flow
```

```python
# --- Online Flow Definition ---
embed_qnode = EmbedQueryNode()
retrieve_node = RetrieveDocsNode()
generate_node = GenerateAnswerNode()

# Define transitions using syntax sugar
embed_qnode - 'retrieve_docs' >> retrieve_node
retrieve_node - 'generate_answer' >> generate_node

OnlineFlow = Flow(start=embed_qnode)
```

Usage example:

```python
# --- Online Flow Execution ---
async def run_online(memory_from_offline: dict):
    # Add the user's question to the memory from the offline stage
    memory_from_offline["question"] = "Why do people like cats?"

    print(f"\nStarting online RAG flow for question: \"{memory_from_offline['question']}\"")
    await OnlineFlow.run(memory_from_offline) # Pass memory object
    # final answer in memory_from_offline["answer"]
    print("Final Answer:", memory_from_offline.get("answer", "N/A")) # Read from memory
    return memory_from_offline

# Example usage combining both stages
async def main():
    # Mock external functions if not defined
    # global get_embedding, create_index, search_index, call_llm
    # get_embedding = ...
    # create_index = ...
    # search_index = ...
    # call_llm = ...

        await run_online(memory_after_offline)
    else:
        print("Skipping online flow due to missing index.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Note: Ensure dummy files exist or are created before running
    # For simplicity, file creation moved to run_offline

================================================
# Map Reduce

MapReduce is a design pattern suitable when you need to process multiple pieces of data (e.g., files, records) independently and then combine the results.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/zvictor/brainyflow/raw/main/.github/media/mapreduce.png?raw=true" width="400"/>
</div>

In BrainyFlow, this pattern is typically implemented using:

1.  **Map Phase:** A "Mapper" node triggers multiple instances of a "Processor" node, one for each piece of data. It uses `trigger` with `forkingData` to pass the specific data item to each processor via its local memory. Using `ParallelFlow` here allows processors to run concurrently.
2.  **Reduce Phase:** A "Reducer" node runs after the map phase. It reads the individual results (accumulated in the global memory by the processor nodes) and aggregates them into a final output.

### Example: Document Summarization

```python
import asyncio
from brainyflow import Node, Flow, Memory, ParallelFlow

# Assume call_llm is defined elsewhere
# async def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str: ...

# 1. Mapper Node: Triggers processing for each file
class TriggerSummariesNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Get file data from global memory
        files_dict = memory.files or {}
        return list(files_dict.items()) # [("file1.txt", "content1"), ...]

    async def exec(self, files: list):
        # No main computation needed here, just return the count for info
        return len(files)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, files_to_process: list, file_count: int):
        print(f"Mapper: Triggering summary for {file_count} files.")
        # Initialize results list and counter in global memory
        memory.file_summaries = [None] * file_count
        memory.remaining_summaries = file_count # Add counter
        # Trigger a 'summarize_file' action for each file
        for index, (filename, content) in enumerate(files_to_process):
            self.trigger('summarize_file', { "filename": filename, "content": content, "index": index })
        # NOTE: 'combine_summaries' is now triggered by SummarizeFileNode when the counter reaches zero.

# 2. Processor Node: Summarizes a single file
class SummarizeFileNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Read specific file data from local memory (passed via forkingData)
        return memory.filename, memory.content, memory.index

    async def exec(self, prep_res):
        filename, content, index = prep_res
        # Summarize the content
        print(f"Processor: Summarizing {filename} (Index {index})")
        return await call_llm(f"Summarize this:\n{content}")

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, summary: str):
        filename, content, index = prep_res
        # Store individual summary in global memory at the correct index
        memory.file_summaries[index] = { "filename": filename, "summary": summary }
        print(f"Processor: Finished {filename} (Index {index})")
        # Decrement counter and trigger combine if this is the last summary
        memory.remaining_summaries -= 1
        if memory.remaining_summaries == 0:
            print("Processor: All summaries collected, triggering combine.")
            self.trigger('combine_summaries')

# 3. Reducer Node: Combines individual summaries
class CombineSummariesNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Read the array of individual summaries (filter out None if any failed)
        summaries = [s for s in (memory.file_summaries or []) if s is not None]
        return summaries

    async def exec(self, summaries: list):
        print(f"Reducer: Combining {len(summaries)} summaries.")
        if not summaries:
            return "No summaries to combine."
        # Format summaries for the final prompt
        combined_text = "\n\n---\n\n".join([f"{s['filename']}:\n{s['summary']}" for s in summaries])
        return await call_llm(f"Combine these summaries into one final summary:\n{combined_text}")

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, final_summary: str):
        # Store the final combined summary
        memory.final_summary = final_summary
        print("Reducer: Final summary generated.")
        # No trigger needed if this is the end

# --- Flow Definition ---
trigger_node = TriggerSummariesNode()
processor_node = SummarizeFileNode()
reducer_node = CombineSummariesNode()

# Define transitions
trigger_node - 'summarize_file' >> processor_node # Map step
trigger_node - 'combine_summaries' >> reducer_node # Reduce step

# Use ParallelFlow for potentially faster summarization
map_reduce_flow = ParallelFlow(start=trigger_node)
# Alternatively, if strict sequential processing is acceptable or required (e.g., to avoid
# the complexity of the counter mechanism), you can use a standard Flow:
# map_reduce_flow = Flow(start=trigger_node)
# This ensures the 'combine_summaries' step (triggered by the last processor)
# only runs after all 'summarize_file' steps are complete.

# --- Execution ---
async def main():
    memory = {
        "files": {
            "file1.txt": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister...",
            "file2.txt": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
            "file3.txt": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
        }
    }
    await map_reduce_flow.run(memory) # Pass memory object
    print('\n--- MapReduce Complete ---')
    print("Individual Summaries:", memory.get("file_summaries"))
    print("\nFinal Summary:\n", memory.get("final_summary"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

File: docs/design_pattern/structure.md
================================================
# Structured Output

In many use cases, you may want the LLM to output a specific structure, such as a list or a dictionary with predefined keys.

There are several approaches to achieve a structured output:

- **Prompting** the LLM to strictly return a defined structure.
- Using LLMs that natively support **schema enforcement**.
- **Post-processing** the LLM's response to extract structured content.

In practice, **Prompting** is simple and reliable for modern LLMs.

### Example Use Cases

- Extracting Key Information

```yaml
product:
  name: Widget Pro
  price: 199.99
  description: |
    A high-quality widget designed for professionals.
    Recommended for advanced users.
```

- Summarizing Documents into Bullet Points

```yaml
summary:
  - This product is easy to use.
  - It is cost-effective.
  - Suitable for all skill levels.
```

- Generating Configuration Files

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  ssl: true
```

## Prompt Engineering

When prompting the LLM to produce **structured** output:

1. **Wrap** the structure in code fences (e.g., `yaml`).
2. **Validate** that all required fields exist (and let `Node` handles retry).

### Example Text Summarization

````python
import yaml
from brainyflow import Node, Memory

# Assume call_llm is defined elsewhere
# async def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str: ...

class SummarizeNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Assuming the text to summarize is in memory.text
        return memory.text or ""

    async def exec(self, text_to_summarize: str):
        if not text_to_summarize:
             return {"summary": ["No text provided"]}

        prompt = f"""
Please summarize the following text as YAML, with exactly 3 bullet points:

{text_to_summarize}

Now, output ONLY the YAML structure:
```yaml
summary:
  - bullet 1
  - bullet 2
  - bullet 3
```"""
        response = await call_llm(prompt)
        structured_result: dict

        try:
            # Extract YAML block
            yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
            structured_result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)

            # Basic validation
            if not isinstance(structured_result, dict) or "summary" not in structured_result or not isinstance(structured_result["summary"], list):
                 raise ValueError("Invalid YAML structure")

        except (IndexError, ValueError, yaml.YAMLError) as e:
            print(f"Failed to parse structured output: {e}")
            # Handle error, maybe return a default structure or re-throw
            return {"summary": [f"Error parsing summary: {e}"]}

        return structured_result # e.g., {"summary": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"]}

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res: dict):
        # Store the structured result in memory
        memory.structured_summary = exec_res
        print("Stored structured summary:", exec_res)
        # No trigger needed if this is the end of the flow/branch
````

{% hint style="info" %}
Besides using `assert` statements, another popular way to validate schemas is [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)
{% endhint %}

### Why YAML instead of JSON?

Current LLMs struggle with escaping. YAML is easier with strings since they don't always need quotes.

**In JSON**

```json
{
  "dialogue": "Alice said: \"Hello Bob.\\nHow are you?\\nI am good.\""
}
```

- Every double quote inside the string must be escaped with `\"`.
- Each newline in the dialogue must be represented as `\n`.

**In YAML**

```yaml
dialogue: |
  Alice said: "Hello Bob.
  How are you?
  I am good."
```

- No need to escape interior quotes—just place the entire text under a block literal (`|`).
- Newlines are naturally preserved without needing `\n`.




================================================
File: docs/design_pattern/multi_agent.md
================================================
# Multi-Agent Systems Pattern

The multi-agent pattern enables complex behaviors by coordinating multiple specialized agents. Each agent focuses on a specific capability while communicating through shared memory and queues.

{% hint style="success" %}
Most of time, you don't need Multi-Agents. Start with a simple solution first.
{% endhint %}

## Example: Agent Communication through Message Queue

Here's a simple example showing how to implement agent communication using `asyncio.Queue`.
The agent listens for messages, processes them, and continues listening:

```python
import asyncio
from brainyflow import Node, Flow

class AgentNode(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        message = await memory.message_queue.get()
        print(f"Agent received: {message}")
        return message

# Create node and flow
agent = AgentNode()
agent >> agent  # connect to self
flow = Flow(start=agent)

# Create heartbeat sender
async def send_system_messages(message_queue):
    counter = 0
    messages = [
        "System status: all systems operational",
        "Memory usage: normal",
        "Network connectivity: stable",
        "Processing load: optimal"
    ]

    while True: # In a real app, add a termination condition
        message = f"{messages[counter % len(messages)]} | timestamp_{counter}"
        await message_queue.put(message)
        counter += 1
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    message_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    # Pass queue via initial memory object
    memory = {"message_queue": message_queue}

    print("Starting agent listener and message sender...")
    # Run both coroutines
    # Note: This will run indefinitely without a termination mechanism
    await asyncio.gather(
        flow.run(memory), # Pass memory object
        send_system_messages(message_queue)
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

The output:

```
Agent received: System status: all systems operational | timestamp_0
Agent received: Memory usage: normal | timestamp_1
Agent received: Network connectivity: stable | timestamp_2
Agent received: Processing load: optimal | timestamp_3
```

## Example: Word Guessing Game (Taboo)

Two agents collaborate in a word guessing game:

- **Hinter**: Provides clues without using forbidden words
- **Guesser**: Attempts to guess the target word based on hints

```python
from brainyflow import Node, Flow
from utils import call_llm
import asyncio

class Hinter(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        """Get the next hint or game state"""
        # Read necessary info from memory
        guess = await memory.guesser_queue.get() # Read from memory queue
        if guess == "GAME_OVER":
            return None # Signal to stop
        return {
            "guess": guess,
            "target_word": memory.target_word, # Pass target word
            "forbidden_words": memory.forbidden_words # Pass forbidden words
        }

    async def exec(self, prep_res):
        """Generate a hint avoiding forbidden words"""
        if prep_res is None:  # Game over signal from prep
            return None

        prompt = f"""
Given target word: {prep_res["target_word"]}
Forbidden words: {prep_res["forbidden_words"]}
Last wrong guess: {prep_res.get('guess')}
Generate a creative hint that helps guess the target word without using forbidden words.
Reply only with the hint text.
"""
        return await call_llm(prompt)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, hint):
        if hint is None:
            self.trigger("end")
            return
        await memory.hinter_queue.put(hint) # Write to memory queue
        self.trigger('continue')

class Guesser(Node):
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        hint = await memory.guesser_queue.get() # Read from memory queue
        # Pass target word for comparison in post
        return {
            "hint": hint,
            "past_guesses": memory.past_guesses if hasattr(memory, 'past_guesses') else [],
            "target_word": memory.target_word
        }

    async def exec(self, prep_res):
        """Make a guess based on the hint"""
        hint = prep_res["hint"]
        past_guesses = prep_res["past_guesses"]
        prompt = f"""
Given hint: {hint}
Past wrong guesses: {past_guesses}
Make a new guess for the target word.
Reply only with the guessed word.
"""
        return await call_llm(prompt)

    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, guess):
        target_word = prep_res["target_word"] # Get target word from prep_res
        if guess.lower() == target_word.lower():
            print('Game Over - Correct guess!')
            await memory.hinter_queue.put("GAME_OVER") # Write to memory queue
            self.trigger('end')
            return

        # Update past guesses in memory
        if not hasattr(memory, 'past_guesses'):
            memory.past_guesses = []
        memory.past_guesses.append(guess) # Write to memory

        await memory.hinter_queue.put(guess) # Write to memory queue
        self.trigger('continue')
```

## Running the Game

```python
async def main():
    # Set up game state in initial memory object
    memory = {
        "target_word": "nostalgia",
        "forbidden_words": ["memory", "past", "remember", "feeling", "longing"],
        "hinter_queue": asyncio.Queue(),
        "guesser_queue": asyncio.Queue(),
        "past_guesses": [] # Initialize past_guesses
    }

    print("Game starting!")
    print(f"Target word: {memory['target_word']}") # Access memory object
    print(f"Forbidden words: {memory['forbidden_words']}") # Access memory object

    # Initialize by sending empty guess to hinter queue in memory
    await memory["hinter_queue"].put("")

    # Create nodes
    hinter = Hinter()
    guesser = Guesser()

    # Set up flows
    hinter_flow = Flow(start=hinter)
    guesser_flow = Flow(start=guesser)

    # Connect nodes to themselves using actions
    hinter - "continue" >> hinter
    guesser - "continue" >> guesser

    # Run both agents concurrently, passing the same memory object
    print('Running agents...')
    await asyncio.gather(
        hinter_flow.run(memory), # Pass memory object
        guesser_flow.run(memory)  # Pass memory object
    )
    print('\nGame finished.')
    print('Final memory state:', memory)

asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run this code, the multi-agent system works as follows:

1. The Hinter agent creates clues (avoiding forbidden words)
2. The Guesser agent makes guesses based on the hints
3. Both agents operate independently but communicate via queues
4. The game continues until the correct word is guessed

The output will look something like:

```
Game starting!
Target word: nostalgia
Forbidden words: ['memory', 'past', 'remember', 'feeling', 'longing']

Hinter: Here's your hint - Thinking about childhood summers
Guesser: I guess it's - happiness

Hinter: Here's your hint - The warm sensation when seeing old photos
Guesser: I guess it's - nostalgia

Game Over - Correct guess!
```

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Systems

This pattern demonstrates several key advantages:

1. **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on a specific task
2. **Independence**: Agents can operate on different schedules or priorities
3. **Coordination**: Agents can collaborate through shared memory and queues
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new agents or modify existing ones
5. **Scalability**: The system can grow to include many specialized agents

# Utility Functions

BrainyFlow does not provide built-in utilities. Instead, we offer examples that you can implement yourself. This approach gives you more flexibility and control over your project's dependencies and functionality.

## Available Utility Function Examples

1. [LLM Wrapper](./llm.md): Interact with Language Models
2. [Web Search](./websearch.md): Perform web searches
3. [Chunking](./chunking.md): Split large texts into manageable chunks
4. [Embedding](./embedding.md): Generate vector embeddings for text
5. [Vector Databases](./vector.md): Store and query vector embeddings
6. [Text-to-Speech](./text_to_speech.md): Convert text to speech

## Why Not Built-in?

We believe it's a bad practice to include vendor-specific APIs in a general framework for several reasons:

1. **API Volatility**: Frequent changes in external APIs lead to heavy maintenance for hardcoded APIs.
2. **Flexibility**: You may want to switch vendors, use fine-tuned models, or run them locally.
3. **Optimizations**: Prompt caching, batching, and streaming are easier to implement without vendor lock-in.

## Implementing Utility Functions

When implementing utility functions for your BrainyFlow project:

1. Create a separate file for each utility function in the `utils/` directory.
2. Include a simple test or example usage in each file.
3. Document the input/output and purpose of each utility function.

Example structure:

```
my_project/
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── call_llm.py
│   ├── search_web.py
│   └── embed_text.py
└── ...
```

By following this approach, you can easily maintain and update your utility functions as needed, without being constrained by the framework's built-in utilities.

================================================
# BrainyFlow Best Practices

## Node Design

1.  **Keep Nodes Focused**: Each node should perform a single, well-defined task.
2.  **Idempotent Execution**: If using retries (`maxRetries > 1`), design the `exec()` method to be idempotent (produce the same result for the same input) as it might be called multiple times.
3.  **Clear Lifecycle**: Use `prep` to read/prepare data, `exec` for computation (no memory access), and `post` to write results and trigger successors.
4.  **Graceful Degradation**: Implement `execFallback` in `Node` subclasses to handle errors gracefully after all retries are exhausted, potentially returning a default value instead of throwing an error.

## Memory (State) Management

1.  **Schema Design**: Define clear interfaces (in TypeScript) or conventions (in Python) for your `GlobalStore` and `LocalStore` structures.
2.  **Global vs. Local**: Use the `GlobalStore` (accessed via `memory.prop = value`) for state shared across the entire flow. Use the `LocalStore` (populated via `forkingData` in `trigger`) for context specific to a particular execution branch.
3.  **Minimize Global State**: Prefer passing data locally via `forkingData` when possible to keep the global state clean and reduce potential conflicts, especially in parallel flows.
4.  **Read Transparently**: Always read via the `memory` proxy (e.g., `memory.value`); it handles the local-then-global lookup.

## Flow Design

1.  **Visualization First**: Sketch your flow diagram (e.g., using Mermaid) before coding to clarify logic and transitions.
2.  **Modularity**: Break complex processes into smaller, potentially nested, sub-flows (`Flow` extends `BaseNode`).
3.  **Explicit Transitions**: Clearly define transitions using descriptive action names (`node.on('action', nextNode)`). Consider default paths (`node.next(defaultNode)`).
4.  **Error Paths**: Define explicit transitions for error conditions (e.g., `node.on('error', errorHandlerNode)`) or handle errors within `execFallback`.
5.  **Cycle Management**: Use the `maxVisits` option in the `Flow` constructor to prevent infinite loops.
6.  **Parallelism**: Choose `ParallelFlow` for independent branches that can run concurrently; use `Flow` (sequential) otherwise or if order matters.
7.  **Test Incrementally**: Test individual nodes (`node.run()`) and sub-flows before integrating them.

## Project Structure

A well-organized project structure enhances maintainability and collaboration:

```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

- **`docs/design.md`**: Contains project documentation for each step designed in [agentic coding](./agentic_coding.md). This should be _high-level_ and _no-code_.
- **`utils/`**: Contains all utility functions.
  - It's recommended to dedicate one file to each API call, for example `call_llm.py` or `search_web.ts`.
  - Each file should also include a `main()` function to try that API call
- **`nodes.py`** or **`nodes.ts`**: Contains all the node definitions.
- **`flow.py`** or **`flow.ts`**: Implements functions that create flows by importing node definitions and connecting them.
- **`main.py`** or **`main.ts`**: Serves as the project's entry point.

# Agentic Coding with BrainyFlow

<details>

<summary>Notes For AI Assistants</summary>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**AI only**: If you are a human, skip this section.
{% endhint %}

This is your implementation playbook and most important guideline. Strictly follow the instructions listed in this document.

Use the design document as your single source of truth. Never proceed to code without explicit human approval of the design.

1.  start with a small and simple solution
2.  design at a high level (`docs/design.md`) before implementation and do not start coding until the design is approved
3.  once approved, start coding and iterate on the design based on feedback
4.  do not stop coding until the implementation is working as intended and fully complaint with the design document

</details>

In the context of Human-AI Co-Design, agentic coding involves humans providing high-level guidance while AI agents handle implementation details:
It represents a powerful approach to software development where humans are freed up to focus solely in strategic decisions.
This guide will help you create effective design documents that enable successful BrainyFlow implementations.

```

- **AI-Driven Structuring:** Convert vague requests into technical specifications through dialogue
- **Essentialism:** Only capture requirements that directly impact implementation
- **Living Documentation:** Design evolves organically through implementation insights

Before writing any code, create a comprehensive AI Implementation Brief at `docs/design.md`. This document serves as the foundation for human-AI collaboration and should contain all the essential sections listed below.

### 1. Requirements Definition

Clearly articulate what you're building and why:

- **Problem Statement**: Define the problem being solved in 1-2 sentences
- **User Needs**: Describe who will use this and what they need
- **Success Criteria**: List measurable outcomes that define success
- **Constraints**: Note any technical or business limitations

Example:

```
We need a document processing system that extracts key information from legal contracts,
summarizes them, and stores the results for easy retrieval. This will help our legal
team review contracts 70% faster.
```

### 2. Flow Design

Outline the high-level architecture using BrainyFlow's nested directed graph abstraction:

- **Flow Diagram**: Create a mermaid diagram showing node connections
- **Processing Stages**: Describe each major stage in the flow
- **Decision Points**: Identify where branching logic occurs
- **Data Flow**: Explain how information moves through the system

Example:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[DocumentLoader] --> B[TextExtractor]
    B --> C[EntityExtractor]
    C --> D[ValidationNode]
    D -->|Valid| E[SummaryGenerator]
    D -->|Invalid| C
    E --> F[DatabaseStorage]
```

### 3. Utility Functions

List all external utilities needed:

- **Function Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Purpose**: What the function does
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Expected parameters and return values
- **External Dependencies**: Any APIs or libraries required

Example:

```
extract_entities(text: str) -> dict:
- Purpose: Uses NER to identify entities in text
- Input: Document text string
- Output: Dictionary of entity lists by type
- Dependencies: spaCy NLP library with legal model
```

### 4. Node Design

For each node in your flow, define:

- **Purpose**: One-line description of what the node does
- **Shared Store Access**: What data it reads from and writes to the shared store
- **Lifecycle Implementation**: How `prep`, `exec`, and `post` will be implemented
- **Action Returns**: What actions the node might return to direct flow
- **Error Handling**: How failures will be managed

Example:

```
EntityExtractorNode:
- Purpose: Identifies parties, dates, and monetary values in contract text
- Reads: document_text from shared store
- Writes: entities dictionary to shared store
- Actions: Returns "valid" if entities found, "retry" if processing failed
- Error Handling: Will retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
```

### 5. Shared Store Schema

Define the structure of your shared store. Using interfaces (TypeScript) or type hints (Python) is highly recommended.

- **Key Namespaces**: Major sections of your shared store (often represented as nested objects or distinct keys).
- **Data Types**: Expected types for each key.
- **Data Flow**: How data evolves through processing (which nodes read/write which keys).

Example:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict, Any

# Define TypedDicts for structure (optional but good practice)
class InputStore(TypedDict):
    document_path: str

class ProcessingStore(TypedDict):
    document_text: str
    entities: Dict[str, List[Any]] # e.g., {"parties": [], "dates": [], "amounts": []}
    validation_status: str

class OutputStore(TypedDict):
    summary: str
    storage_id: str

# Conceptual structure of the memory object using separate keys
# (Actual implementation might use a single dict or class instance)
memory_conceptual = {
    "document_path": "path/to/file.pdf", # str
    "document_text": "",                 # str
    "entities": {                        # Dict[str, List[Any]]
        "parties": [],
        "dates": [],
        "amounts": []
    },
    "validation_status": "",             # str
    "summary": "",                       # str
    "storage_id": ""                     # str
}

# Note: In BrainyFlow, you typically access these directly, e.g.,
# memory.document_text = "..."
# entities = memory.entities
# This conceptual breakdown helps in planning the data flow.
```

## Best Practices for Your Design Document

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the minimal viable solution
2. **Be Explicit**: Clearly define all components and their interactions
3. **Visualize Flows**: Use diagrams to illustrate complex relationships
4. **Define Boundaries**: Clarify what's in and out of scope
5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Note how the system handles failures
6. **Be Concise**: Keep it short and to the point; Do not add any other section to the design document other than the ones listed above

## Implementation Process

After completing your design document:

1. **Review with Stakeholders**: Ensure the design meets requirements. If you are the AI agent, ask the user to verify the design document and confirm it fits their needs.
2. **Refine as Needed**: Iterate on the design based on feedback
3. **Hand Off to AI**: Provide the design document to your AI assistant - If you are the AI agent, start working on the solution based on the design document
4. **Collaborative Implementation**: Work with AI to implement the design
5. **Test and Validate**: Verify the implementation against success criteria

Once the AI assistant starts working on the implementation it's common for it to get lazy midway through the implementation.
Whenever it claims to be done, you can give it an extra push with the following prompt:

```markdown
Review the design document and the whole implemented code, then answer the following questions:

- are all stubs and placeholders gone?
- have all requirements and features been implemented?
- have you successfully run the application and all tests?
- what should be implemented next?

If the answer to any question is "no", or you can name something to be implemented next, then you are not done yet.
Go back to working and finish it! Do not stop until you are done.
```

<details>

<summary>Notes For AI Assistants</summary>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**AI only**: If you are a human, skip this section.
{% endhint %}

Be sure you **always** strictly follow these instructions:

1. **Be Patient**: Do not start the implementation until the design document is approved.
2. **Be Brainy**: Import `brainyflow` and use its archictecture to implement the design document! Adhere to the proposed flow, node and shared store design.
3. **Focus on What Matters**: Do not fix types or edge cases until you are certain the core implementation is working as intended.
4. **Be Adaptive**: Continuously refine the design document based on feedback and changes in the implementation, but keep it clear and concise.
5. **Be Compliant**: You must always write code that is compliant with the design document and the system's architecture. Remember to stick to the flow, node and shared store design:
   - prep(memory)
     Read and preprocess data from the memory object.
   - exec(prep_res)
     Execute compute logic. Receives result from prep. Cannot access memory.
   - post(memory, prep_res, exec_res)
     Postprocess results, write data back to the memory object (usually global store), and trigger next actions.
6. **Be Resilient**: You are not done until the implementation is working as intended.
7. **Be Accountable**: Before finishing the implementation, ask yourself the following questions:
   - are all stubs and placeholders gone?
   - have all requirements and features been implemented?
   - have I successfully run the application and all tests?
   - what should be implemented next?
     If the answer to any question is "no", or you can name something to be implemented next, then you are not done yet.
     Go back to working and finish it!

</details>

## Conclusion: Precision Through Structure

This approach ensures all BrainyFlow solutions maintain:

- **Human Focus:** Strategic requirements and validation

- **AI Precision:** Structured implementation targets

- **System Integrity:** Clear component boundaries

By enforcing these four pillars through adaptive dialogue rather than rigid templates, we achieve flexible yet reliable AI system development. The design document becomes a living contract between human intent and AI execution.

You provide your AI assistant with the clear direction needed to implement an effective BrainyFlow solution while maintaining human oversight of the critical design decisions.

Remember: The quality of your design document directly impacts the quality of the implementation. Invest time in creating a comprehensive brief to ensure successful outcomes.

# Rate Limiting and Throttling

Effective rate limiting is crucial when working with external APIs and services. This guide covers patterns for implementing throttling in BrainyFlow applications.

This is particularly important when:

1. Calling external APIs with rate limits
2. Managing expensive operations (like LLM calls)
3. Preventing system overload from too many parallel requests

## Concurrency Control Patterns

These patterns limit the number of concurrent operations within a node.

```python
import asyncio
from brainyflow import Node, Memory # Assuming imports

class LimitedParallelNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, concurrency_limit: int = 3, **kwargs): # Allow passing other Node args
        super().__init__(**kwargs) # Call parent constructor
        if concurrency_limit <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Concurrency limit must be positive")
        self._semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency_limit)
        print(f"Node initialized with concurrency limit: {concurrency_limit}")

    # Prep is usually needed to get 'items' from memory
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        # Example: Fetch items from memory
        items = memory.items_to_process or []
        print(f"Prep: Found {len(items)} items to process.")
        return items # Assuming items are in memory.items_to_process

    async def exec(self, items: list): # exec receives result from prep
        if not items:
            print("Exec: No items to process.")
            return []

        async def limited_task_runner(item):
            async with self._semaphore:
                print(f" Starting processing item: {item}")
                # process_one_item should ideally be defined in the subclass or passed in
                result = await self.process_one_item(item) # Renamed for clarity
                print(f" Finished processing item: {item} -> {result}")
                return result

        print(f"Exec: Starting processing of {len(items)} items with limit {self._semaphore._value}...")
        tasks = [limited_task_runner(item) for item in items]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print("Exec: All items processed.")
        return results

    async def process_one_item(self, item):
        """Placeholder: Subclasses must implement this method."""
        # Example implementation:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5) # Simulate async work
        return f"Processed_{item}"
        # raise NotImplementedError("process_one_item must be implemented by subclasses")

    # Post is needed to store results and trigger next step
    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res: list, exec_res: list):
        print(f"Post: Storing {len(exec_res)} results.")
        memory.processed_results = exec_res # Store results
        self.trigger('default') # Trigger next node
```

## Rate Limiting with Window Limits

```python
from ratelimit import limits, sleep_and_retry

# 30 calls per minute
@sleep_and_retry
@limits(calls=30, period=60)
def call_api():
    # Your API call here
    pass
```

## Throttler Utility

```python
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt

@retry(
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(5)
)
def call_api_with_retry():
    # Your API call here
    pass
```

## Advanced Throttling Patterns

### 1. Token Bucket Rate Limiter

```python
from pyrate_limiter import Duration, Rate, Limiter

# 10 requests per minute
rate = Rate(10, Duration.MINUTE)
limiter = Limiter(rate)

@limiter.ratelimit("api_calls")
async def call_api():
    # Your API call here
    pass
```

### 2. Sliding Window Rate Limiter

```python
from slidingwindow import SlidingWindowRateLimiter

limiter = SlidingWindowRateLimiter(
    max_requests=100,
    window_size=60  # 60 seconds
)

async def call_api():
    if not limiter.allow_request():
        await asyncio.sleep(limiter.time_to_next_request()) #  or raise RateLimitExceeded()
    # Your API call here
    return "API response"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor API Responses**: Watch for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses and adjust your rate limiting accordingly
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: When hitting rate limits, implement exponential backoff for retries
3. **Distribute Load**: If possible, spread requests across multiple API keys or endpoints
4. **Cache Responses**: Cache frequent identical requests to reduce API calls
5. **Batch Requests**: Combine multiple requests into single API calls when possible

## Integration with BrainyFlow

### Throttled LLM Node

```python
class ThrottledLLMNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, max_retries=3, wait=1, calls_per_minute=30):
        super().__init__(max_retries=max_retries, wait=wait) # Pass wait to super
        self.limiter = Limiter(Rate(calls_per_minute, Duration.MINUTE))

    # Prep is needed to get the prompt from memory
    async def prep(self, memory: Memory):
        return memory.prompt # Assuming prompt is in memory.prompt

    async def exec(self, prompt): # exec receives prompt from prep
        @self.limiter.ratelimit('llm_calls')
        async def limited_llm_call(text):
            # Assuming call_llm is async
            return await call_llm(text)

        # Add basic check for empty prompt
        if not prompt:
             return "No prompt provided."
        return await limited_llm_call(prompt)

    async def exec_fallback(self, prompt, error): # Make fallback async
        # Handle rate limit errors specially
        # Note: Retrying within fallback can lead to complex loops.
        # Consider just logging or returning an error message.
        if "rate limit" in str(error).lower():
            print(f"Rate limit hit for prompt: {prompt[:50]}...")
            # Fallback response instead of complex retry logic here
            return f"Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later. Error: {error}"
        # For other errors, fall back to a simple response
        print(f"LLM call failed after retries: {error}")
        return f"I'm having trouble processing your request right now. Error: {error}"

    # Post is needed to store the result and trigger next step
    async def post(self, memory: Memory, prep_res, exec_res):
        memory.llm_response = exec_res # Store the result
        self.trigger('default') # Trigger next node
```

# Testing and Debugging BrainyFlow Applications

Effective testing and debugging are essential for building reliable applications. This guide covers strategies for testing and debugging complex flows, and monitoring applications in production.

## Testing Approaches

BrainyFlow supports multiple testing approaches to ensure your applications work correctly:

### Unit Testing (Nodes)

Individual nodes can be tested in isolation to verify their behavior:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from brainyflow import Node

class TestSummarizeNode(unittest.TestCase):
    async def test_summarize_node(self):
        # Create the node
        summarize_node = SummarizeNode()

        # Create a mock shared store
        memory = {"text": "This is a long text that needs to be summarized."}

        # Mock the LLM call
        with patch('utils.call_llm', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_llm:
            mock_llm.return_value = "Short summary."

            # Run the node
            await summarize_node.run(memory)

            # Verify the node called the LLM with the right prompt
            mock_llm.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_llm.call_args[0][0]
            self.assertIn("summarize", call_args.lower())

            # Verify the result was stored correctly
            self.assertEqual(memory.summary, "Short summary.") # Access memory object

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use asyncio.run for async tests if needed, or run within an existing loop
    # For simplicity, assuming standard unittest runner handles async test cases
    unittest.main()
```

### Integration Testing (Flows)

Test complete flows to verify that nodes work together correctly:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from brainyflow import Flow

class TestQuestionAnsweringFlow(unittest.TestCase):
    async def test_qa_flow(self):
        # Create the flow
        qa_flow = create_qa_flow()

        # Create a mock shared store
        memory = {"question": "What is the capital of France?"}

        # Mock all LLM calls
        with patch('utils.call_llm', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_llm:
            # Configure the mock to return different values for different prompts
            def mock_llm_side_effect(prompt):
                if "search" in prompt.lower():
                    return "Paris is the capital of France."
                elif "answer" in prompt.lower():
                    return "The capital of France is Paris."
                return "Unexpected prompt"

            mock_llm.side_effect = mock_llm_side_effect

            # Run the flow
            await qa_flow.run(memory)

            # Verify the final answer
            self.assertEqual(memory.answer, "The capital of France is Paris.") # Access memory object

            # Verify the LLM was called the expected number of times
            self.assertEqual(mock_llm.call_count, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Use asyncio.run for async tests if needed
    unittest.main()
```

## Testing Approaches

### Unit Testing Individual Nodes

1. **Isolate Dependencies**: Mock external services and LLM calls
2. **Test Each Lifecycle Method**: Verify `prep`, `exec`, and `post` individually
3. **Test Error Handling**: Ensure `exec_fallback` works as expected
4. **Verify Memory Updates**: Check if memory is modified correctly
5. **Test Triggers**: Ensure the right actions are triggered

### Integration Testing Flows

1. **Mock External Services**: Keep tests deterministic by mocking APIs
2. **Verify End-to-End Behavior**: Test the entire flow from start to finish
3. **Test Branching Logic**: Ensure different paths work correctly
4. **Check Final Memory State**: Verify that the memory contains expected results
5. **Test Error Handling**: Make sure flows handle errors gracefully

### Testing Strategies

#### Testing LLM-Based Nodes

For nodes that call LLMs, you can use these approaches:

1.  **Canned Responses**: Prepare fixed responses for specific prompts.
2.  **Prompt Verification**: Check if prompts contain expected information.
3.  **Response Validation**: Test if the node correctly handles various LLM responses.

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import asyncio

# Mock LLM with canned responses based on prompt content
async def mock_llm_logic(prompt: str) -> str:
    if "summarize" in prompt.lower():
        return "This is a summary."
    elif "extract" in prompt.lower():
        # Simulate returning a JSON-like string
        return '{"key": "value"}'
    else:
        return "Default response"

# Example usage in a test
async def test_node_with_mocked_llm():
    # Assume MyLlmNode calls utils.call_llm internally
    # node = MyLlmNode()
    # memory = Memory.create({"input": "some text to summarize"})

    # Use patch to replace the actual call_llm
    with patch('utils.call_llm', new=AsyncMock(side_effect=mock_llm_logic)) as mock_call:
        # await node.run(memory) # Run the node that uses the LLM
        pass # Replace pass with actual node execution

    # Assertions can be made here on memory state or mock calls
    # mock_call.assert_called_once()
    # assert memory.summary == "This is a summary."

# asyncio.run(test_node_with_mocked_llm())
````

#### Testing Retry Logic

To test retry behavior:

1.  **Simulate Transient Failures**: Make the mock function fail a few times before succeeding.
2.  **Check Retry Count**: Verify that retries happened the expected number of times (e.g., by checking `node.cur_retry` inside the mock or tracking calls).
3.  **Test Backoff**: If using `wait`, mock `asyncio.sleep` (Python) or `setTimeout` (TypeScript) to verify delays without actually waiting.

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import asyncio
# from brainyflow import Node # Assuming Node is imported

# Mock function that fails twice, then succeeds
call_count_retry = 0
async def mock_fails_then_succeeds(*args, **kwargs):
    global call_count_retry
    call_count_retry += 1
    print(f"Mock called (Attempt {call_count_retry})") # For debugging test
    if call_count_retry <= 2:
        raise ValueError("Temporary network failure")
    return "Success on third try"

# Example Node (conceptual)
# class NodeWithRetry(Node):
#     def __init__(self):
#         super().__init__(max_retries=3, wait=0.1) # Retry up to 3 times (4 attempts total)
#     async def exec(self, prep_res):
#         # This method calls the function we will mock
#         return await some_external_call(prep_res)

async def test_retry_logic():
    global call_count_retry
    call_count_retry = 0 # Reset counter for test
    # node = NodeWithRetry()
    # memory = Memory.create({})

    # Patch the external call made within node.exec
    # Also patch asyncio.sleep to avoid actual waiting
    with patch('__main__.some_external_call', new=AsyncMock(side_effect=mock_fails_then_succeeds)), \
         patch('asyncio.sleep', new=AsyncMock()) as mock_sleep:

        # await node.run(memory) # Run the node
        pass # Replace pass with actual node execution

    # Assertions
    # assert call_count_retry == 3 # Should be called 3 times (1 initial + 2 retries)
    # assert memory.result == "Success on third try" # Check final result
    # assert mock_sleep.call_count == 2 # Check if sleep was called between retries

# asyncio.run(test_retry_logic())

```

## Test Fixtures and Helpers

Creating helper functions can make tests more readable and maintainable.

```python
# Example helpers (can be placed in a conftest.py for pytest or a base class for unittest)
# from brainyflow import Memory, Node # Assuming imports

def create_default_test_memory() -> dict:
    """Creates a standard dictionary for test memory."""
    return {"input": "test data", "config": {"setting": "value"}}

async def run_node_with_memory(node: Node, initial_memory: dict | None = None) -> dict:
    """Runs a node with provided or default initial memory."""
    memory_obj = initial_memory if initial_memory is not None else create_default_test_memory()
    # Assuming node.run modifies the dictionary in place or returns it
    await node.run(memory_obj)
    return memory_obj

def assert_memory_contains(memory: dict, expected_data: dict):
    """Asserts that the memory dictionary contains the expected key-value pairs."""
    for key, value in expected_data.items():
        assert key in memory, f"Memory missing key: {key}"
        assert memory[key] == value, f"Memory value mismatch for key '{key}': expected {value}, got {memory[key]}"

# Example usage in a test
# async def test_my_node_output():
#     node = MyProcessingNode()
#     final_memory = await run_node_with_memory(node)
#     assert_memory_contains(final_memory, {"output": "processed data", "status": "completed"})

```

## Common Testing Patterns

### 1. Input Validation Testing

Test that nodes properly handle invalid or unexpected inputs.

```python
# Requires: pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
import pytest
# from brainyflow import Node, Memory # Assuming imports
# from my_nodes import MyNodeThatValidates # Your node

@pytest.mark.parametrize("invalid_input", [None, "", {}, [], {"wrong_key": 1}])
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_node_handles_invalid_input(invalid_input):
    """Tests if the node handles various invalid inputs gracefully."""
    node = MyNodeThatValidates() # Node that should validate memory.input_data
    memory = {"input_data": invalid_input} # Pass invalid data

    # Expect the node to run without unhandled exceptions
    # and potentially set an error state or default output
    await node.run(memory)

    # Example assertions: Check for an error flag or a specific state
    assert memory.get("error_message") is not None or memory.get("status") == "validation_failed"
    # Or assert that a default value was set
    # assert memory.get("output") == "default_value"

```

### 2. Flow Path Testing

Test that flows follow the expected paths based on node triggers.

```python
import asyncio
# from brainyflow import Node, Flow, Memory # Assuming imports

async def test_flow_follows_correct_path():
    """Tests if the flow executes nodes in the expected sequence."""
    visited_nodes_log = []

    # Define simple tracking nodes
    class SimpleTrackingNode(Node):
        def __init__(self, name: str, trigger_action: str = "default"):
            super().__init__()
            self._node_name = name
            self._trigger_action = trigger_action

## Best Practices

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Each Node Individually**: Verify that each node performs its specific task correctly
2. **Test Flows as Integration Tests**: Ensure nodes work together as expected
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for LLMs, APIs, and databases to ensure consistent testing
4. **Test Error Handling**: Explicitly test how your application handles failures
5. **Automate Tests**: Include BrainyFlow tests in your CI/CD pipeline

### Debugging Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a minimal flow and add complexity incrementally
2. **Visualize Your Flow**: Generate flow diagrams to understand the structure
3. **Isolate Issues**: Test individual nodes to narrow down problems
4. **Check Shared Store**: Verify that data is correctly passed between nodes
5. **Monitor Actions**: Ensure nodes are returning the expected actions

### Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Monitor Node Performance**: Track execution time for each node
2. **Watch for Bottlenecks**: Identify nodes that take longer than expected
3. **Track Error Rates**: Monitor how often nodes and flows fail
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for critical failures
5. **Log Judiciously**: Log important events without overwhelming storage
6. **Implement Distributed Tracing**: Use tracing for complex, distributed applications

By applying these testing techniques, you can ensure your BrainyFlow applications are reliable and maintainable.
