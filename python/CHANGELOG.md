## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 83cb809: ## Automatic Triggers Propagation

  Since v2.0, Caskada propagates triggers from **terminal nodes** (i.e. _nodes missing successors_) to subsequent flows. This let you permeate an action from a node directly to outside of the parent flow, skipping the need to explicitly re-trigger the actions at the end of every flow execution.

  This allows for more fluid and permeable flows, and effectively stops the parent flow from being a rigid barrier in the graph execution.
  Think about it as "_handing over unfinished tasks in a flow to the first node in the next flow_".

  It also means that you can **preserve the concurrency of that execution path as you navigate into the next flow**: the execution doesnâ€™t end at the leaf node, it continues into the next flow.

  ### Ignoring Implicit Triggers Propagation

  In v2.1 we are stopping the propagation of **Implicit Triggers** - _the default action that is automatically triggered when no `.trigger()` was explicitly called_ - to give users more control over trigger's propagation and avoid unexpected behavior.

  Thus, this is the behaviour you can expect:

  1. If a terminal node **does NOT** explicitly call `.trigger()`, **no action is propagated** from that terminal node.
  2. If a terminal node **calls** `.trigger()`, then the parent flow **propagates** that action to its own sucessors - and any forking data passed is preserved.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 10289fa: # Major Refactor and Enhancement Release (Python)

  This release introduces a significant overhaul of the `Memory` class, refines `Flow` execution and cycle detection, and improves overall type safety and developer experience.

  ## Breaking Changes

  - **Flow as Node - Trigger Propagation**: When a sub-flow (acting as a node) has an internal node triggering an action for which the sub-flow has no defined successor, this action now correctly propagates as a trigger from the sub-flow node itself in the parent flow's `ExecutionTree`.
  - **Simplified Generic Type Hints**: The generic type hints for `Flow` and `Node` have been simplified, removing the `L` (i.e. `LocalMemory`) type parameter and moving the `ActionT` to the end of the list as it is rarely used. Before: `Node[G, L, ActionT, PrepResultT, ExecResultT]`; Now: `Node[G, PrepResultT, ExecResultT, ActionT]`.
  - **NodeError**: Changed from an `Exception` subclass to a `Protocol` (`runtime_checkable`). This affects how `NodeError` might be caught or checked, promoting structural typing and fixing the double-raising of the exception.
  - **New License**: Caskada is now licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

  Rarely used other than internally, but still breaking changes:

  - **Memory Creation**: The static method `Memory.create(global_store, local_store=None)` has been removed. To create `Memory` instances, just pass a dict to `flow.run({ ... })` as you always did, or use the standard constructor: `Memory(global_store, local_store=None)`.
  - **Flow Execution Result (`Flow.run()`)**: The `run()` method of a `Flow` now returns an `ExecutionTree` (a `TypedDict` with `order: int`, `type: str`, `triggered: Optional[Dict[Action, List[ExecutionTree]]]`). This provides a structured log of the execution, replacing the previous, less defined dictionary structure. Code that previously traversed the `run()` result will need to be updated to work with the new `ExecutionTree` format.
  - **Internal Node Order (`_node_order`)**: This is now consistently an integer.

  ## Core Library Changes & New Features

  ### Memory Management (`Memory` Class)

  - **Enhanced Proxy Behavior**:
    - `memory.local` now returns a dedicated `LocalProxy` instance, providing isolated attribute and item access (`getattr`, `getitem`, `setattr`, `setitem`, `delattr`, `delitem`, `contains`) that operates _only_ on the local store.
    - The main `Memory` object's attribute/item access (`memory.foo`, `memory['foo']`) continues to prioritize local then global for reads.
    - Writes (`memory.foo = 'bar'`, `memory['foo'] = 'bar'`) now consistently write to the global store, removing the key from the local store first if it exists there.
  - **Comprehensive Deletion Support**:
    - `del memory.attr` and `del memory[key]` now delete the key from _both_ global and local stores if present in either (delegating to `_delete_from_stores`).
    - `del memory.local.attr` and `del memory.local[key]` delete _only_ from the local store.
  - **Helper Functions**: Internal `_get_from_stores` and `_delete_from_stores` utility functions have been added to centralize store access logic.
  - **Cloning**: `memory.clone(forking_data=None)` remains, ensuring deep copy of the local store and merging of `forking_data`. Global store is shared by reference.

  ### Flow Execution & Cycle Detection

  - **`Flow.run()` and `ExecutionTree`**: As mentioned in Breaking Changes, returns a structured `ExecutionTree`.
  - **Default `maxVisits`**: Increased from 5 to 15 in the `Flow` constructor for cycle detection.
  - **Cycle Detection Error Message**: Improved format to: `Maximum cycle count ({max_visits}) reached for {ClassName}#{node_order}`.

  ### Node Lifecycle and Error Handling

  - **`NodeError` Protocol**: Now a `typing.Protocol` for more flexible error handling. `error.retry_count` is added to exceptions during the retry mechanism in `Node.exec_runner`.
  - **Warnings**:
    - The warning "Node won't run successors. Use Flow!" when `run()` is called on a `BaseNode` with successors has been **removed** to reduce noise. #20
    - Warning for an "orphan action" (action triggered with no successor) in `get_next_nodes` has been refined for better clarity: `Flow ends for node {ClassName}#{node_order}: Action '{action}' not found in its defined successors [...]`.

  ### Type Annotations & Developer Experience

  - **Improved Type Hints**: Extensive improvements to type annotations throughout the library using `TypeVar`, `Generic`, `Protocol`, `TypeAlias`, and `TypedDict` for better static analysis and developer understanding. All MyPy errors and inconsistencies addressed.
  - **Test Suite Enhancements**:
    - Tests for new `Memory` deletion features and `LocalProxy` behavior.
    - Updated assertions for the new `ExecutionTree` structure.
    - `BaseNode._next_id` is reset in test fixtures/setups for predictable node ordering in tests.
    - More robust mocking and assertions for flow execution paths.
  - **Documentation**:
    - Migration guide (`migrating_from_pocketflow.md`) updated with clearer steps for `async`, trigger usage, memory access, and the new batch processing pattern.
    - Core abstraction documentation (`flow.md`, `design.md`) updated to reflect changes (e.g., `maxVisits`, `Memory` creation).
    - "Contributors Wanted!" section added to `README.md`.

  ## Infrastructure Improvements

  - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow `changeset-check.yml` updated to use `changesets/action@v1.4.9` and properly prepare the Python directory for changeset tooling.
  - **`.envrc`**: Added `dotenv_if_exists`.
  - **`.gitignore`**: Added `python/README.md` (if it's auto-generated and shouldn't be committed).

  This release significantly modernizes the Python Caskada library, especially its state management capabilities and execution tracking, while enhancing type safety and the overall development experience.
