# Design Patterns

BrainyFlow supports a variety of design patterns that enable you to build complex AI applications. These patterns leverage the core abstractions of nodes, flows, and shared store to implement common AI system architectures.

## Overview of Design Patterns

BrainyFlow's minimalist design allows it to support various high-level AI design paradigms:

| Pattern                             | Description                                                     | Use Cases                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [RAG](./rag.md)                     | Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge-grounded responses | Question answering, knowledge-intensive tasks   |
| [Agent](./agent.md)                 | Autonomous entities that can perceive, reason, and act          | Virtual assistants, autonomous decision-making  |
| [Workflow](./workflow.md)           | Sequential or branching business processes                      | Form processing, approval flows                 |
| [MapReduce](./map_reduce.md)        | Distributed processing of large datasets                        | Document summarization, parallel processing     |
| [Structured Output](./structure.md) | Generating outputs that follow specific schemas                 | Data extraction, configuration generation       |
| [Multi-Agents](./multi_agent.md)    | Multiple agents working together on complex tasks               | Collaborative problem-solving, role-based tasks |

## Choosing the Right Pattern

When designing your application, consider these factors when selecting a pattern:

| Pattern           | Best For                  | When To Use                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| RAG               | Knowledge-intensive tasks | When external information is needed for responses       |
| Agent             | Dynamic problem-solving   | When tasks require reasoning and decision-making        |
| Workflow          | Sequential processing     | When steps are well-defined and follow a clear order    |
| Map Reduce        | Large data processing     | When handling datasets too large for a single operation |
| Structured Output | Consistent formatting     | When outputs need to follow specific schemas            |
| Multi-Agents      | Complex collaboration     | When tasks benefit from specialized agent roles         |

### Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to help determine which pattern best fits your use case:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Need to process large data?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Data can be processed independently?}
    B -->|No| D{Need to make decisions?}

    C -->|Yes| E[Map Reduce]
    C -->|No| F[Workflow]

    D -->|Yes| G{Complex, multi-step reasoning?}
    D -->|No| H[Simple Workflow]

    G -->|Yes| I{Need multiple specialized roles?}
    G -->|No| J{Need external knowledge?}

    I -->|Yes| K[Multi-Agents]
    I -->|No| L[Agent]

    J -->|Yes| M[RAG]
    J -->|No| N[Structured Output]
```

## Pattern Composition

BrainyFlow's nested flow capability allows you to compose multiple patterns. For instance:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Agent Pattern"
        A[Perceive] --> B[Think]
        B --> C[Act]
        C --> A
    end

    subgraph "RAG Pattern"
        D[Query] --> E[Retrieve]
        E --> F[Generate]
    end

    A --> D
    F --> B
```

This composition enables powerful applications that combine the strengths of different patterns.
For example, an agent might use RAG to access knowledge, then apply chain-of-thought reasoning to solve a problem.
Other examples include:

- An **Agent** that uses **RAG** to retrieve information before making decisions
- A **Workflow** that includes **Map Reduce** steps for processing large datasets
- **Multi-Agents** that each use **Structured Output** for consistent communication

## Implementation Examples

Each pattern can be implemented using BrainyFlow's core abstractions. Here's a simple example of the agent pattern:

```python
# Define the agent's components
perceive = PerceiveNode()
think = ThinkNode()
act = ActNode()

# Connect them in a cycle
perceive >> think >> act >> perceive

# Create the agent flow
agent_flow = Flow(start=perceive)
```

For more detailed implementations of each pattern, see the individual pattern documentation pages.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest pattern that meets your needs
2. **Modular Design**: Design patterns to be composable and reusable
3. **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces between pattern components
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each pattern component before integration
5. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for bottlenecks in your pattern implementation

By understanding and applying these design patterns, you can build sophisticated AI applications that are both powerful and maintainable.
