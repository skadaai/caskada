# Understanding BrainyFlow's Core Abstractions

BrainyFlow is built around a simple yet powerful abstraction: the **nested directed graph with shared store**. This mental model separates _data flow_ from _computation_, making complex LLM applications more maintainable and easier to reason about.

## Core Philosophy

BrainyFlow follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Modularity & Composability**: Build complex systems from simple, reusable components that are easy to build, test, and maintain
2. **Explicitness**: Make data dependencies between steps clear and traceable
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Data storage (shared store) remains separate from computation logic (nodes)
4. **Minimalism**: The framework provides only essential abstractions, avoiding vendor-specific implementations while supporting various high-level AI design paradigms (agents, workflows, map-reduce, etc.)
5. **Resilience**: Handle failures gracefully with retries and fallbacks

## The Graph + Shared Store Pattern

The fundamental pattern in BrainyFlow combines two key elements:

- **Computation Graph**: A directed graph where nodes represent discrete units of work and edges represent the flow of control
- **Shared Store**: A global data structure that enables communication between nodes

This pattern offers several advantages:

- **Clear visualization** of application logic
- **Easy identification** of bottlenecks
- **Simple debugging** of individual components
- **Natural parallelization** opportunities

## Key Components

BrainyFlow's architecture is based on these fundamental building blocks:

| Component                           | Description             | Key Features                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Node](./node.md)                   | The basic unit of work  | Clear lifecycle (`prep → exec → post`), fault tolerance, graceful fallbacks |
| [Flow](./flow.md)                   | Connects nodes together | Action-based transitions, branching, looping, nesting                       |
| [Communication](./communication.md) | Enables data sharing    | Shared Store (global), Params (node-specific)                               |
| [Batch](./batch.md)                 | Handles multiple items  | Sequential or parallel processing, nested batching                          |

## How They Work Together

1. **Nodes** perform individual tasks with a clear lifecycle:

   - `prep`: Read from shared store and prepare data
   - `exec`: Execute computation (often LLM calls)
   - `post`: Process results and write to shared store

2. **Flows** orchestrate nodes by:

   - Starting with a designated node
   - Following action-based transitions between nodes
   - Supporting branching, looping, and nested flows

3. **Communication** happens through:

   - **Shared Store**: A global dictionary accessible to all nodes
   - **Params**: Node-specific configuration passed down from parent flows

4. **Batch Processing** enables:
   - Processing multiple items sequentially or in parallel
   - Handling large datasets efficiently
   - Supporting nested batch operations

## Getting Started

If you're new to BrainyFlow, we recommend exploring these core abstractions in the following order:

1. [Node](./node.md) - Understand the basic building block
2. [Flow](./flow.md) - Learn how to connect nodes together
3. [Communication](./communication.md) - See how nodes share data
4. [Batch](./batch.md) - Explore handling multiple items

Once you understand these core abstractions, you'll be ready to implement various [Design Patterns](../design_pattern/index.md) to solve real-world problems.
